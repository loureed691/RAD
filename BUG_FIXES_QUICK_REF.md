# Quick Bug Fixes Summary

## What Was Fixed?

### 1. VWAP Using Wrong Calculation Method ⚠️ CRITICAL
**File:** indicators.py, line 76  
**Issue:** Used cumsum() which grows indefinitely  
**Fix:** Changed to 50-period rolling window  
**Impact:** VWAP now accurate and responsive to recent prices

### 2. Volume Ratio Causing NaN/Infinity ⚠️ HIGH  
**File:** indicators.py, lines 68-71  
**Issue:** Division by zero when volume_sma is 0 or NaN  
**Fix:** Added `.replace(0, np.nan).fillna(1.0)`  
**Impact:** No more NaN/inf values breaking calculations

### 3. Position Manager Not Checking for NaN ⚠️ MEDIUM
**File:** position_manager.py, line 465-469  
**Issue:** Didn't check if SMA values are NaN before division  
**Fix:** Added `pd.isna()` checks for both SMA values  
**Impact:** Trailing stops and take-profits now reliable

## How to Test

```bash
# Run all tests
python test_bot.py          # 12/12 tests
python test_bug_fixes.py    # 4/4 tests
```

## What Changed?

**3 files modified:**
- indicators.py (VWAP + volume_ratio fixes)
- position_manager.py (NaN handling)
- test_bug_fixes.py (NEW - verification tests)

**No breaking changes** - All existing functionality preserved

## Results

✅ All 16 tests passing  
✅ No NaN propagation  
✅ VWAP within 5% of current prices  
✅ Safe fallbacks for all edge cases  
✅ Ready for production

## Before vs After

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| VWAP Accuracy | Poor (drifts) | Good (<5% diff) |
| NaN Handling | Poor | Excellent |
| Position Mgmt | Unreliable | Reliable |
| Risk Level | HIGH | LOW |
