# Trading Bot Diagnostic Logging - Quick Start

## Problem
Bot not trading? Can't figure out why?

## Solution
We've added comprehensive diagnostic logging that shows exactly why trades are or aren't executing.

## Quick Diagnosis (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Start the bot
```bash
python bot.py
```

### Step 2: Check the logs
```bash
# In another terminal
tail -f logs/bot.log
```

### Step 3: Look for these messages

**‚úÖ Trade Executed:**
```
‚úÖ TRADE EXECUTED - Successfully opened BUY position for BTC-USDT
```

**‚ùå Trade Rejected (with reason):**
```
‚ùå TRADE REJECTED - Trade validation failed: Confidence too low (0.45 < 0.6)
‚ùå TRADE REJECTED - Not opening position: Maximum positions reached (3)
‚ùå TRADE REJECTED - No available balance
‚ùå TRADE REJECTED - Diversification check failed for BTC-USDT: Too many positions in crypto group (2/2)
```

**üìä Scan Summary:**
```
üìä SCAN SUMMARY: Attempted 3 trades, executed 1
```

## Common Issues

### 1. No Opportunities Found
**Message:** `‚ö†Ô∏è  No trading opportunities found in market scan`

**Fix:** Lower confidence threshold or wait for better market conditions

### 2. Low Confidence Signals  
**Message:** `‚ùå TRADE REJECTED - Confidence too low (0.45 < 0.6)`

**Fix:** Adjust `min_confidence` in `risk_manager.py` line 393, or wait for stronger signals

### 3. Maximum Positions
**Message:** `‚ùå TRADE REJECTED - Maximum positions reached (3)`

**Fix:** Increase `MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS` in `.env` or close existing positions

### 4. No Balance
**Message:** `‚ùå TRADE REJECTED - No available balance`

**Fix:** Deposit more funds or close profitable positions

## Grep Commands for Quick Diagnosis

```bash
# Why are trades being rejected?
grep "TRADE REJECTED" logs/bot.log

# Are opportunities being found?
grep "Found.*opportunities" logs/bot.log

# What's the success rate?
grep "SCAN SUMMARY" logs/bot.log

# Any errors?
grep "ERROR" logs/bot.log
```

## What Changed

Every validation step now logs clearly:
- ‚úì Shows when checks pass
- ‚ùå Shows exactly why checks fail (with values and thresholds)
- üìä Shows summaries of trade attempts vs executions
- üîç Shows what opportunities the scanner found

**Before:** "Trade not valid" üòï
**After:** "‚ùå TRADE REJECTED - Trade validation failed: Confidence too low (0.45 < 0.6)" üí°

## Files Modified
