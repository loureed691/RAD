# Leverage Sync Bug Fix - Summary

## Problem
All positions were being synced with 10x leverage regardless of their actual leverage on the exchange.

### Root Cause
In `position_manager.py` line 527, the code used a simple fallback:
```python
leverage = int(pos.get('leverage', 10))
```

This only checked the CCXT unified `leverage` field. If the exchange returned leverage in a different field (like KuCoin's `realLeverage` in the `info` dict), it would default to 10x.

### Impact
- Positions opened with 5x leverage were tracked as 10x
- Positions opened with 20x leverage were tracked as 10x
- P/L calculations became incorrect (2x error for 5x positions, 0.5x error for 20x positions)
- Risk management decisions were based on wrong leverage values
- Stop loss and take profit calculations were inaccurate

## Solution

### Code Changes
Modified `sync_existing_positions()` in `position_manager.py` to use a robust multi-step extraction:

```python
# Extract leverage with multiple fallback options
# 1. Try CCXT unified 'leverage' field
leverage = pos.get('leverage')
if leverage is not None:
    leverage = int(leverage)
else:
    # 2. Try KuCoin-specific 'realLeverage' in raw info
    info = pos.get('info', {})
    real_leverage = info.get('realLeverage')
    if real_leverage is not None:
        leverage = int(real_leverage)
    else:
        # 3. Default to 10x with warning
        leverage = 10
        self.logger.warning(
            f"Leverage not found for {symbol}, defaulting to 10x. "
            f"Position data: contracts={contracts}, side={side}"
        )
```

### Features
1. **Multi-source extraction**: Checks both CCXT unified field and KuCoin-specific field
2. **Clear warnings**: Logs warning when leverage is missing and defaulting to 10x
3. **Better logging**: Adds detailed sync logs showing what leverage was detected
4. **Backward compatible**: Still defaults to 10x if leverage truly isn't available

## Testing

### New Test Suite
Created `test_leverage_sync_fix.py` with 4 comprehensive tests:

1. ✅ **Leverage from CCXT unified structure** - Verifies standard CCXT leverage field works
2. ✅ **Leverage from KuCoin realLeverage** - Verifies KuCoin-specific field works
3. ✅ **Missing leverage defaults to 10x** - Verifies safe fallback with warning
4. ✅ **Multiple positions with different leverages** - Verifies all scenarios work together

All tests pass.

### Demo Script
Created `demo_leverage_fix.py` showing:
- Before/after comparison
- Real-world scenarios with different leverage values
- Edge case handling with missing leverage

### Validation
- Existing `test_position_sync.py` tests still pass
- P/L calculations verified with different leverage values (3x, 10x, 20x)
- No regression in other position management features

## Example

### Before Fix
```
Exchange positions:
  BTC: 5x leverage  →  Synced as 10x ❌
  ETH: 20x leverage →  Synced as 10x ❌
  SOL: 3x leverage  →  Synced as 10x ❌
```

### After Fix
```
Exchange positions:
  BTC: 5x leverage  →  Synced as 5x ✅
  ETH: 20x leverage →  Synced as 20x ✅
  SOL: 3x leverage  →  Synced as 3x ✅
```

## Impact

### P/L Accuracy
With a 5% price move:
- **5x leverage position**: Was showing 50% ROI (10x), now correctly shows 25% ROI (5x)
- **20x leverage position**: Was showing 50% ROI (10x), now correctly shows 100% ROI (20x)

### Risk Management
- Stop loss calculations now use actual leverage
- Take profit targets are accurate
- Position sizing respects actual risk exposure

## Files Modified
- `position_manager.py`: Enhanced leverage extraction in `sync_existing_positions()`

## Files Added
- `test_leverage_sync_fix.py`: Comprehensive test suite
- `demo_leverage_fix.py`: Demonstration script
- `LEVERAGE_SYNC_FIX.md`: This documentation

## Deployment
- No configuration changes needed
- No API changes
- No breaking changes
- Safe to deploy immediately
- Backward compatible (still defaults to 10x if leverage unavailable)
