# Auto-Configuration Feature

## Overview

The trading bot now features **ultra-minimal configuration** - you only need to provide your KuCoin API credentials! Everything else is automatically configured with optimal defaults based on your account balance, market conditions, and industry best practices.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

**Just 3 lines of configuration:**

```env
KUCOIN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
KUCOIN_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
KUCOIN_API_PASSPHRASE=your_api_passphrase_here
```

That's it! The bot automatically configures everything else.

## How It Works

When the bot starts, it:
1. Connects to KuCoin and fetches your USDT balance
2. Analyzes your balance tier (Micro, Small, Medium, Large, Very Large)
3. Automatically configures optimal parameters for that tier
4. Applies risk-appropriate settings based on account size
5. Enables all advanced features with optimal defaults

## What Gets Auto-Configured

### ‚öôÔ∏è Trading Parameters (Balance-Based)
These are automatically set based on your account balance:
- **LEVERAGE**: 4-12x (smaller accounts = lower leverage for safety)
- **MAX_POSITION_SIZE**: 30-60% of balance (scaled appropriately)
- **RISK_PER_TRADE**: 1-3% (conservative for small, aggressive for large)
- **MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD**: 0.62-0.92% (includes trading fees + profit)

### üéØ Features & Strategies (Optimal Defaults)
All enabled with best-practice settings:
- **WebSocket**: Enabled (real-time market data)
- **Dashboard**: Enabled on port 5000 (monitor your trades)
- **DCA Strategy**: Enabled (Dollar Cost Averaging for better entries)
- **Hedging**: Enabled (portfolio protection)

### ‚è±Ô∏è Bot Timing (Performance-Optimized)
Fine-tuned for best results:
- **CHECK_INTERVAL**: 60s (optimal balance, no rate limiting)
- **POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL**: 3s (40% faster trailing stops)
- **LIVE_LOOP_INTERVAL**: 0.1s (100ms, truly live monitoring)
- **MAX_WORKERS**: 20 (fast parallel scanning)
- **MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS**: 3 (balanced diversification)

## Balance Tiers & Auto-Configuration

The bot intelligently adjusts settings based on your account size:

### Micro Account ($10-$100)
**Purpose:** Learning and testing with minimal capital

**Auto-Configured:**
- **Leverage:** 4x (very conservative, protect your capital)
- **Max Position Size:** 30% of balance (e.g., $30 on $100)
- **Risk Per Trade:** 1.0% (very careful, preserve capital)
- **Min Profit Threshold:** 0.92% (covers fees + small profit)

**Why:** Micro accounts need maximum protection. Lower leverage and risk percentage preserve capital while you learn the markets.

---

### Small Account ($100-$1,000)
**Purpose:** Growing a small account carefully

**Auto-Configured:**
- **Leverage:** 6x (conservative, safer growth)
- **Max Position Size:** 40% of balance (e.g., $200 on $500)
- **Risk Per Trade:** 1.5% (cautious but growing)
- **Min Profit Threshold:** 0.72% (covers fees + decent profit)

**Why:** Small accounts benefit from conservative settings to build confidence and a positive track record.

---

### Medium Account ($1,000-$10,000)
**Purpose:** Balanced growth with moderate risk

**Auto-Configured:**
- **Leverage:** 8x (balanced, industry standard)
- **Max Position Size:** 50% of balance (e.g., $2,500 on $5,000)
- **Risk Per Trade:** 2.0% (standard risk management)
- **Min Profit Threshold:** 0.62% (covers fees + good profit)

**Why:** This is the "sweet spot" for most traders. Standard risk management principles apply with good growth potential.

---

### Large Account ($10,000-$100,000)
**Purpose:** Experienced trading with moderate-aggressive settings

**Auto-Configured:**
- **Leverage:** 10x (moderate-aggressive, experienced trader level)
- **Max Position Size:** 60% of balance (e.g., $30,000 on $50,000)
- **Risk Per Trade:** 2.5% (aggressive but calculated)
- **Min Profit Threshold:** 0.62% (covers fees + good profit)

**Why:** Larger accounts can handle slightly more aggressive settings while maintaining professional risk management.

---

### Very Large Account ($100,000+)
**Purpose:** Professional-level trading

**Auto-Configured:**
- **Leverage:** 12x (professional level, calculated aggression)
- **Max Position Size:** 60% of balance (capped at $50,000 for safety)
- **Risk Per Trade:** 3.0% (professional risk tolerance)
- **Min Profit Threshold:** 0.62% (covers fees + good profit)

**Why:** Very large accounts benefit from maximum efficiency while still maintaining professional risk management standards.

## Overriding Auto-Configuration

**Most users don't need to override anything!** But if you're an advanced user who wants custom settings:

### Simple Overrides

Just add any parameter to your `.env` file:

```env
# Required: API credentials
KUCOIN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
KUCOIN_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
KUCOIN_API_PASSPHRASE=your_api_passphrase_here

# Optional: Override any auto-configured value
LEVERAGE=8                   # Use 8x instead of auto (4-12x)
RISK_PER_TRADE=0.015        # Use 1.5% risk instead of auto (1-3%)
MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS=5        # Allow 5 positions instead of 3
ENABLE_DASHBOARD=false      # Disable the web dashboard
```

The bot will:
- ‚úÖ Use your custom value for overridden parameters
- ‚úÖ Auto-configure all remaining parameters
- ‚úÖ Log which settings are user-defined vs auto-configured

### What You'll See

## Migration from Manual Configuration

### Upgrading from Previous Versions

**Option 1: Use Auto-Configuration (Recommended)**

1. Open your `.env` file
2. Comment out or delete these lines:
   ```env
   # LEVERAGE=10
   # MAX_POSITION_SIZE=1000
   # RISK_PER_TRADE=0.02
   # MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD=0.005
   # CHECK_INTERVAL=60
   # MAX_WORKERS=8
   # ENABLE_WEBSOCKET=true
   # ENABLE_DASHBOARD=true
   # ENABLE_DCA=true
   # ENABLE_HEDGING=true
   ```
3. Keep only your API credentials:
   ```env
   KUCOIN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   KUCOIN_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
   KUCOIN_API_PASSPHRASE=your_api_passphrase_here
   ```
4. Start the bot - it will auto-configure everything!

**Option 2: Keep Your Custom Settings**

Do nothing! Your existing `.env` values will override auto-configuration. The bot will:
- Use your custom values where provided
- Auto-configure anything not specified
- Work exactly as before

---

## Testing Auto-Configuration

Want to see how settings change with different balances? Run this test:

```bash
python test_minimal_config.py
```

This will verify:
- ‚úÖ Only 3 required config lines (API credentials)
- ‚úÖ All features auto-configure with optimal defaults
- ‚úÖ Balance-based settings work correctly
- ‚úÖ All tiers (Micro to Very Large) configure properly

Or test programmatically:

```python
from config import Config

# Test with different balances
Config.auto_configure_from_balance(500)     # Small account
print(f"Small: {Config.LEVERAGE}x leverage, {Config.RISK_PER_TRADE:.1%} risk")

Config.auto_configure_from_balance(5000)    # Medium account
print(f"Medium: {Config.LEVERAGE}x leverage, {Config.RISK_PER_TRADE:.1%} risk")

Config.auto_configure_from_balance(50000)   # Large account
print(f"Large: {Config.LEVERAGE}x leverage, {Config.RISK_PER_TRADE:.1%} risk")
```

---

## Safety Features

The auto-configuration includes multiple safety mechanisms:

### üõ°Ô∏è Built-in Protections
1. **Balance Validation**: Falls back to safe defaults if balance fetch fails
2. **Bounds Checking**: All parameters capped at safe min/max values
3. **Position Caps**: MAX_POSITION_SIZE capped at $50,000 (no matter account size)
4. **Risk Limits**: Risk per trade capped between 1% and 3%
5. **Leverage Limits**: Leverage capped between 4x and 12x
6. **Warnings**: Alerts if settings are aggressive (>10x leverage, >2.5% risk)

### üéØ Conservative Defaults
- Smaller accounts get MORE conservative settings (4x leverage vs 12x)
- Risk scales gradually (1% for micro, 3% for very large)
- Position sizing prevents overexposure (30-60% of balance)
- Profit thresholds include trading fees (0.12%) plus profit margin

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Fail-Safe Behavior
If balance fetch fails, the bot uses these safe defaults:
- **LEVERAGE**: 10x (moderate, safe for most)
- **MAX_POSITION_SIZE**: $1,000 (reasonable for testing)
- **RISK_PER_TRADE**: 2% (standard risk management)
- **MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD**: 0.62% (covers fees + profit)

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Do I really only need 3 lines of configuration?**  
A: Yes! Just your KuCoin API key, secret, and passphrase. Everything else auto-configures.

**Q: Can I still use manual configuration?**  
A: Absolutely! Set any value in `.env` and it will override auto-configuration.

**Q: Is this suitable for beginners?**  
A: Perfect for beginners! You get safe, appropriate settings automatically without needing to research complex parameters.

**Q: What about experienced traders?**  
A: Great for quick deployment. You get optimal defaults instantly, but can override anything you want.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What happens if balance fetch fails?**  
A: The bot falls back to safe defaults (10x leverage, $1000 max position, 2% risk) and logs a warning.

**Q: Will settings change while the bot is running?**  
A: No, settings are determined once at startup based on initial balance.

**Q: How often should I restart to re-calibrate?**  
A: Optional, but recommended weekly or when balance changes significantly (>20%).

**Q: Are advanced features like DCA and Hedging enabled by default?**  
A: Yes! All advanced features are enabled with optimal settings.

### Customization Questions

**Q: What if I want more aggressive settings?**  
A: Set your preferred values in `.env` to override. Example: `LEVERAGE=15` for 15x leverage.

**Q: Can I disable the dashboard?**  
A: Yes: `ENABLE_DASHBOARD=false` in `.env`

**Q: How do I use multiple workers for faster scanning?**  
A: Already optimized! Default is 20 workers. You can increase: `MAX_WORKERS=30`

**Q: Can I change the scan interval?**  
A: Yes: `CHECK_INTERVAL=120` for 2-minute scans instead of 1-minute.

## Recommendations

### üåü Best Practices

1. **Start with defaults**: Let the bot auto-configure for at least 50 trades
2. **Monitor performance**: Check dashboard and logs for first week
3. **Only override if needed**: Don't customize unless you have a specific reason
4. **Be conservative**: Better to grow slowly than blow up your account
5. **Regular restarts**: Restart weekly to re-calibrate as balance grows

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ‚ùå **Don't manually set leverage too high** (>15x is very risky)
2. ‚ùå **Don't set risk >5%** (preserve capital for drawdowns)
3. ‚ùå **Don't disable WebSocket** (real-time data is crucial)
4. ‚ùå **Don't set CHECK_INTERVAL <30s** (may hit API rate limits)
5. ‚ùå **Don't run multiple bots** with same API credentials (rate limiting)

### ‚úÖ When to Override

Override auto-configuration only if:
- You have specific strategy requirements
- You're testing a hypothesis
- You have deep trading experience
- You understand the risks

Otherwise, trust the defaults - they're optimized for your account size and based on industry best practices.

---

## Technical Details

The auto-configuration logic is in `config.py`:

```python
Config.auto_configure_from_balance(available_balance)
```

This method:
1. Checks for environment variable overrides (user-defined values take precedence)
2. Determines balance tier (Micro, Small, Medium, Large, Very Large)
3. Applies tier-specific settings (leverage, risk, position size, profit threshold)
4. Logs all configuration decisions (shows what's auto vs user-defined)
5. Ensures all values are within safe bounds (prevents dangerous settings)

The settings are applied once during bot initialization in `bot.py` after fetching the account balance.

---

## Summary

**üéâ Configuration is now ultra-simple:**
- ‚úÖ Only 3 lines required (KuCoin API credentials)
- ‚úÖ All features auto-enabled with optimal defaults
- ‚úÖ Settings adapt to your account size
- ‚úÖ Safe for beginners, powerful for pros
- ‚úÖ Easy to override if needed

**Just add your API keys and start trading!** üöÄ
