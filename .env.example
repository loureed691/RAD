POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=1.0         # Position update interval (seconds) - 1s for fast trailing stops

MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS=3
MAX_WORKERS=20                       # Number of parallel workers for market scanning (higher = faster scanning)
CACHE_DURATION=300                   # Cache duration in seconds - ONLY used for scanning, NOT for trading! Trades always use live data.
STALE_DATA_MULTIPLIER=3              # Increased from 2 to 3 to reduce false rejections of valid opportunities

# Trading Signal Thresholds (NEW - helps fix "bot not trading" issue)
# These control how selective the bot is about trading opportunities
# Lower values = more trades, Higher values = fewer but higher quality trades
MIN_SIGNAL_CONFIDENCE=0.50           # Signal generation threshold (default: 0.50 = 50%)
MIN_TRADE_CONFIDENCE=0.55            # Trade execution validation (default: 0.55 = 55%)
# Note: These were reduced from 0.55/0.60 to allow trading in normal market conditions
# while still filtering out weak signals. Adjust based on your risk tolerance.
