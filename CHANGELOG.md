# Changelog

All notable changes to the RAD KuCoin Futures Trading Bot will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

#### Isolated Margin Mode Error (Code 330006)
- **Problem**: Bot was failing to create orders with error "Current mode is set to isolated margin. Please switch to cross margin before making further adjustments." (code: 330006)
- **Root Cause**: When a position or account is already in isolated margin mode, attempting to set leverage or create orders fails even with the correct margin mode parameter
- **Solution**: Added `set_margin_mode('cross', symbol)` call before `set_leverage()` in both `create_market_order()` and `create_limit_order()` methods to explicitly switch from isolated to cross margin mode
- **Impact**: Bot can now switch from isolated to cross margin mode and create orders successfully regardless of the initial margin mode state
- **Files**: `kucoin_client.py` lines 178, 208

#### Margin Mode Mismatch Error (Code 330005)
- **Problem**: Bot was failing to create orders with error "The order's margin mode does not match the selected one. Please switch and try again." (code: 330005)
- **Root Cause**: While leverage was being set with cross margin mode, the order creation itself didn't explicitly specify the margin mode parameter
- **Solution**: Added `params={"marginMode": "cross"}` to both `create_market_order()` and `create_limit_order()` methods in `kucoin_client.py`
- **Impact**: Orders can now be created successfully with the correct margin mode matching the leverage setting
- **Files**: `kucoin_client.py` lines 189, 220

#### Futures Pair Detection Issue
- **Problem**: Bot was only detecting 1 futures contract (quarterly BTC futures) instead of all available contracts
- **Root Cause**: The `get_active_futures()` method in `kucoin_client.py` was only checking for `market.get('future')` which missed perpetual swaps
- **Solution**: Updated filter to `(market.get('swap') or market.get('future'))` to detect both:
  - Perpetual swaps (swap=True) - e.g., BTC/USDT:USDT, ETH/USDT:USDT
  - Dated futures (future=True) - e.g., BTC/USD:BTC-251226
- **Impact**: Bot now scans all available futures contracts instead of just quarterly futures
- **File**: `kucoin_client.py` line 28-48

#### Indicator Calculation Failures
- **Problem**: Bot was showing "Could not calculate indicators" warnings for all pairs
- **Root Cause**: Multiple issues causing empty DataFrames:
  1. Insufficient OHLCV data (<50 candles required)
  2. API fetch failures not properly retried
  3. Errors during indicator calculation not properly handled
- **Solutions**:
  1. Added retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff) for OHLCV fetching
  2. Added explicit check for minimum data requirement (50 candles)
  3. Wrapped indicator calculations in try-except for graceful error handling
  4. Enhanced logging to show exact data counts and failure reasons
- **Impact**: Better error handling and more reliable indicator calculations
- **Files**: 
  - `kucoin_client.py` lines 55-76 (OHLCV fetching with retry)
  - `indicators.py` lines 14-67 (improved error handling)
  - `market_scanner.py` lines 20-50 (better diagnostics)

#### Enhanced Logging and Diagnostics
- **Changes**:
  - Added debug logging showing breakdown of perpetual vs dated futures
  - Added warning when OHLCV data is insufficient with exact candle count
  - Added retry attempt logging for API failures
  - More descriptive error messages in market scanner
- **Impact**: Easier to diagnose issues and understand bot behavior
- **Files**: `kucoin_client.py`, `market_scanner.py`

### Added

#### Comprehensive Test Coverage
- **New Tests**:
  1. `test_futures_filter()` - Validates new market filtering logic
  2. `test_insufficient_data_handling()` - Tests graceful handling of edge cases
- **Coverage**:
  - Verifies detection of both perpetual swaps and dated futures
  - Confirms old filter only found 1 contract vs new filter finding 4+ contracts
  - Tests handling of insufficient data (<50 candles)
  - Tests handling of empty/None data
- **File**: `test_bot.py` lines 192-260

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Before
```
Found 1 active futures pairs
Scanning 1 trading pairs...

Scanned BTC/USD:BTC-251226: Signal=HOLD, Confidence=0.00, Score=0.00
Market scan complete. Found 0 trading opportunities
```

### After
```
Found 50+ active futures pairs
Breakdown: 45 perpetual swaps, 5 dated futures
Scanning 50+ trading pairs...
Fetched 100 candles for BTC/USDT:USDT
Scanned BTC/USDT:USDT: Signal=BUY, Confidence=0.72, Score=75.5
Scanned ETH/USDT:USDT: Signal=SELL, Confidence=0.65, Score=68.2
...
Market scan complete. Found 15 trading opportunities
```

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes. The fixes are backward compatible and will automatically improve bot behavior.

## Technical Details

### Market Types in KuCoin Futures
- **Perpetual Swaps**: `type='swap', swap=True, contract=True` - No expiry date, funding rate
- **Quarterly Futures**: `type='future', future=True, contract=True` - Fixed expiry date
- **Both**: Should have `active=True` to be tradeable

### Minimum Data Requirements
- **50 candles minimum**: Required for proper technical indicator calculation
- **SMA 50**: Needs 50 periods
- **Other indicators**: Need sufficient warmup period

### OHLCV Retry Logic
- **3 attempts**: With exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 3s delays)
- **Handles**: Network errors, rate limits, temporary API issues
- **Falls back**: Returns empty list if all attempts fail
