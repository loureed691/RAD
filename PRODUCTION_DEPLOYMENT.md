## ✅ Production Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/loureed691/RAD.git
cd RAD

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API credentials
nano .env  # or your preferred editor
```

### Step 2: Configuration
```bash
# Minimal required configuration:
KUCOIN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
KUCOIN_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
KUCOIN_API_PASSPHRASE=your_passphrase_here

# Optional: Override auto-configuration
# LEVERAGE=10
# MAX_POSITION_SIZE=1000
# RISK_PER_TRADE=0.02
# MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD=0.0062
```

### Step 3: Pre-Flight Checks
```bash
# Test imports
python -c "from bot import TradingBot; print('✅ Bot imports successfully')"

# Run tests
python -m pytest test_bot.py -v

# Check configuration
python -c "from config import Config; Config.validate(); print('✅ Configuration valid')"
```

### Step 4: Launch
```bash
# Start the bot
python bot.py

# Monitor logs
tail -f logs/bot.log

# Monitor alerts
tail -f logs/alerts.log
```

### Step 5: Monitoring

**Dashboard (if enabled):**
- Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
- Monitor positions, trades, and performance

**Log Files:**
- `logs/bot.log` - Main bot log with all activity
- `logs/alerts.log` - Critical alerts and warnings
- `logs/positions.log` - (deprecated, now in bot.log)
- `logs/scanning.log` - (deprecated, now in bot.log)

**Health Checks:**
- Production monitor reports status every 15 minutes
- Check for any health warnings in logs
- Monitor alert log for critical events

## ✅ Production Best Practices

### 1. Start Small
- [ ] Start with minimum balance to test
- [ ] Use conservative leverage (≤5x) initially
- [ ] Monitor first 10-20 trades closely
- [ ] Gradually increase position sizes

### 2. Monitor Continuously
- [ ] Check dashboard regularly
- [ ] Monitor alert log
- [ ] Review trade performance
- [ ] Track drawdown
- [ ] Check win rate

### 3. Safety First
- [ ] Never share API credentials
- [ ] Keep API permissions minimal (only futures trading)
- [ ] Set exchange account limits as backup
- [ ] Have emergency shutdown plan
- [ ] Keep sufficient balance for positions

### 4. Maintenance
- [ ] Review logs daily
- [ ] Check for updates weekly
- [ ] Backup models/ directory regularly
- [ ] Monitor system resources
- [ ] Update dependencies as needed

## ✅ Emergency Procedures

### Kill Switch
If you need to immediately stop all trading:
1. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the bot gracefully
2. Or send SIGTERM: `kill -TERM <pid>`
3. Or set KILL_SWITCH=true in risk manager
4. Bot will close positions if configured

### API Issues
If API calls are failing:
1. Circuit breaker will activate automatically after 5 consecutive failures
2. Check internet connection
3. Check KuCoin API status
4. Verify API credentials
5. Check rate limits

### Position Issues
If positions aren't updating:
1. Bot syncs with exchange on startup
2. Check logs for errors
3. Verify WebSocket connection
4. Restart bot if needed
5. Positions will be recovered from state

### Data Issues
If bot stops finding opportunities:
1. Check scanner health in logs
2. Verify market conditions
3. Check API rate limits
4. Monitor scan success rate
5. Restart if scan failures persist

## ✅ Performance Targets

### Expected Performance (with proper configuration):
- **Win Rate**: 70-82% (with AI enhancements)
- **Annual Returns**: 80-120%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 2.5-3.5
- **Max Drawdown**: 12-15%
- **Average Trade Duration**: 4-24 hours
- **Daily Trades**: 1-5 (depends on market)

### Warning Signs:
- Win rate below 50% for >20 trades
- Drawdown exceeding 20%
- Consecutive losses >7
- No trades for >24 hours in active market
- API failures >20 in an hour

## ✅ Support & Resources

### Documentation
- README.md - Overview and quick start
- AUTO_CONFIG.md - Configuration guide
- DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md - Dashboard usage
- 2025_AI_ENHANCEMENTS.md - AI features
- 2026_ENHANCEMENTS.md - Advanced features

### Monitoring Tools
- Web Dashboard: http://localhost:5000
- Log files in logs/ directory
- Production monitor status reports
- Performance metrics

### Troubleshooting
1. Check logs/bot.log for errors
2. Check logs/alerts.log for critical events
3. Review configuration in .env
4. Verify API credentials
5. Test network connection
6. Check system resources

## ✅ Success Criteria

The bot is production-ready when:
- [x] All pre-flight checks pass
- [x] Bot runs for 1 hour without errors
- [x] First 5 trades execute successfully
- [x] Monitoring shows healthy status
- [x] No critical alerts triggered
- [x] State saves working correctly
- [x] Positions recover after restart

## Notes

- **Profitability**: Not guaranteed. Past performance doesn't predict future results.
- **Risk**: Crypto trading is risky. Only trade with money you can afford to lose.
- **Monitoring**: Always monitor the bot. Don't leave it unattended for days.
- **Updates**: Check for updates regularly for bug fixes and improvements.
- **Backup**: Keep backups of your models/ directory to preserve ML training.
