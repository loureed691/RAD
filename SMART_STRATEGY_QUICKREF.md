# Smart Strategy Quick Reference

## What Changed?

### 🎯 Leverage Strategy: Now 10x Smarter!
**Before:** Simple 2-factor (volatility + confidence) → 3-15x
**Now:** 8-factor intelligent system → 3-20x

### 💰 Position Sizing: Adaptive Kelly
**Before:** Fixed half-Kelly (0.5) → 0.5-3.0% cap
**Now:** Adaptive fractional (0.4-0.65) → 0.5-3.5% cap

## 8 Factors That Determine Leverage

1. **Volatility** (base: 3-16x) - More granular 7-tier classification
2. **Confidence** (±3x) - Signal quality
3. **Momentum** (±2x) - Price movement strength
4. **Trend** (±2x) - Trend strength indicator
5. **Market Regime** (±2x) - Trending/ranging/neutral
6. **Win/Loss Streak** (±3x) - Recent performance pattern
7. **Recent Performance** (±2x) - Last 10 trades win rate
8. **Drawdown** (-10x max) - Automatic protection

## Adaptive Kelly in Action

### Consistent Performance
```
Historical: 58% win rate
Recent (10 trades): 60% win rate
Consistency: 98%
→ Uses 60% Kelly (more aggressive)
```

### Inconsistent Performance
```
Historical: 58% win rate
Recent (10 trades): 30% win rate
Consistency: 72%
→ Uses 55% Kelly (more conservative)
```

### During Loss Streak
```
3+ consecutive losses
→ Kelly reduced by 30%
5+ consecutive wins
→ Kelly boosted by 10% (capped)
```
