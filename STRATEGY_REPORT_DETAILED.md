## Strategy Methodology

### Core Strategy Components

The RAD bot uses a **multi-indicator, regime-adaptive strategy** that combines:

1. **Trend Following** (Moving Averages, MACD)
2. **Mean Reversion** (RSI, Bollinger Bands)
3. **Momentum Analysis** (ROC, Momentum Indicator)
4. **Volume Confirmation** (Volume Ratio)
5. **Multi-Timeframe Analysis** (1h, 4h, 1d)
6. **Market Regime Detection** (Trending, Ranging, Neutral)

### Signal Generation Logic

```
Entry Signals = f(RSI, MACD, EMAs, Volume, Momentum, Regime)

Long Entry:
  - RSI < oversold_threshold (25-35)
  - MACD > Signal Line
  - EMA(12) > EMA(26)
  - Volume Ratio > min_threshold (0.6-1.2)
  - Momentum > threshold (if trending regime)

Short Entry:
  - RSI > overbought_threshold (65-80)
  - MACD < Signal Line
  - EMA(12) < EMA(26)
  - Volume Ratio > min_threshold
  - Momentum < -threshold (if trending regime)

Exit Conditions:
  - Stop Loss: 1.5-5% (adaptive)
  - Take Profit: 3-10% (adaptive)
  - Trailing Stop: 1.5-4% (when profitable)
  - RSI reversal signals
  - Time-based exits
```

### Regime Adaptation

The strategy adapts to market regimes:

**Trending Markets:**
- Emphasize trend-following signals (MACD, EMAs)
- Higher momentum thresholds
- Wider stops and targets
- Follow the trend direction

**Ranging Markets:**
- Emphasize mean-reversion signals (RSI, Bollinger Bands)
- Lower momentum thresholds
- Tighter stops and targets
- Counter-trend entries

**Neutral Markets:**
- Balanced approach
- Stricter entry criteria
- Faster exits

### Position Sizing

Position size is determined by:

```python
base_position_size = balance * position_size_pct  # 5-25%
leverage = 3-8x (based on account size and optimization)
actual_position = base_position_size * leverage

# Risk-based adjustment
if volatility_high:
    actual_position *= 0.7
if confidence_low:
    actual_position *= 0.8
```

### Multi-Asset Strategy

For multi-asset portfolios:
- Correlation-based diversification
- Shared risk budget
- Position limits per asset class
- Dynamic allocation based on regime

## Optimization Process

### Bayesian Optimization Framework

**Tool:** Optuna (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator)  
**Trials:** 100+ recommended for production  
**Validation:** Walk-forward with multiple scenarios

### Optimization Objective

Maximize composite score:

```python
score = (
    2.0 * (profit_factor - 1.2)     # Weight: 2.0
  + 1.5 * (sharpe_ratio - 1.0)      # Weight: 1.5
  + 1.0 * (sortino_ratio - 1.5)     # Weight: 1.0
  + 2.0 * (15.0 - max_dd) / 15.0    # Weight: 2.0 (inverted)
  + 1.0 * (win_rate - 0.45) / 0.45  # Weight: 1.0
  + 1.5 * total_return              # Weight: 1.5
)

# Heavy penalties for target violations
if profit_factor < 1.2:
    score -= 5.0 * (1.2 - profit_factor)
if sharpe_ratio < 1.0:
    score -= 3.0 * (1.0 - sharpe_ratio)
# ... etc
```

### Walk-Forward Validation

**Process:**
1. Generate diverse market scenarios (500+)
2. For each parameter set:
   - Test on 10+ representative scenarios
   - Calculate aggregate metrics
   - Score against targets
3. Update Bayesian prior
4. Sample next parameter set
5. Repeat until convergence

### Optimization Procedure

```bash
# Run optimization
make optimize

# Review results
cat optimization_results.json

# Extract best parameters
python -c "
import json
with open('optimization_results.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    params = data['best_params']
    for key, value in params.items():
        print(f'{key}: {value}')
"

# Update config with best parameters
# Test in paper mode before going live
```
