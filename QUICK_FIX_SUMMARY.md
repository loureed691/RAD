# QUICK FIX SUMMARY: "Bot Doesn't Sell Anymore"

## Problem
Bot wasn't closing positions at take profit targets.

## Root Cause
Take profit was being extended AWAY from current price as price approached it, creating an unreachable moving target.

## The Fix
**File**: `position_manager.py`
**Lines**: 268-273 (LONG), 295-300 (SHORT)

Changed from:
```python
if progress_pct < 0.8:  # Allowed extension up to 80%
    self.take_profit = new_take_profit
else:
    # Complex checks that still allowed moving away
    if new_distance <= old_distance * 1.2:
        self.take_profit = new_take_profit
```

To:
```python
if progress_pct < 0.75:  # Only allow extension before 75%
    self.take_profit = new_take_profit
else:
    pass  # Lock TP when price is close (≥75%)
```

## What Changed
- **Before**: TP could extend at any time → moved away as price approached
- **After**: TP locked in once price is ≥75% to target

## Impact
✅ Positions now close at take profit
✅ TP extension still works for trending markets (<75% progress)
✅ Minimal code change (12 lines across 2 sections)

## Testing
```bash
python3 test_tp_fix.py
# Result: ✓✓✓ ALL TESTS PASSED ✓✓✓ (4/4)
```

## Verification
```python
# SHORT: Price at $92, TP at $90 (80% progress)
# Before: TP extends to $89 (moves away)
# After:  TP stays at $90 (locks in) ✅

# LONG: Price at $108, TP at $110 (80% progress)  
# Before: TP extends to $111 (moves away)
# After:  TP stays at $110 (locks in) ✅
```

## Quick Start
1. **Symptom**: Positions not closing at take profit
2. **Fix**: Already applied in `position_manager.py`
3. **Test**: Run `python3 test_tp_fix.py`
4. **Deploy**: Changes are backward compatible
5. **Monitor**: Watch for take profit closures in logs
