# Live Trading - Quick Reference

## What's New?

**The bot now trades LIVE** - positions are monitored continuously instead of in cycles.

## TL;DR

- **Old**: Bot checks positions every 60 seconds
- **New**: Bot checks positions every 5 seconds
- **Result**: 12x faster reaction time, no missed opportunities

## Quick Start

### 1. Update Your `.env` (Optional)

The bot works with defaults, but you can customize:

```env
# How often to check positions (default: 5 seconds)
POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=5

# How often to scan for new opportunities (default: 60 seconds)
CHECK_INTERVAL=60
```

### 2. Restart Your Bot

That's it! The bot will now:
- ‚úÖ Update positions every 5 seconds
- ‚úÖ Scan for opportunities every 60 seconds
- ‚úÖ Never miss a trade

## What You'll Notice

### Faster Reactions
- Stop losses trigger in ~5 seconds instead of ~30 seconds
- Take profits capture peaks faster
- Trailing stops adjust in real-time

### More Log Activity (When Trading)
```
üíì Monitoring 2 position(s)... (next scan in 55s)
üíì Monitoring 2 position(s)... (next scan in 50s)
üíì Monitoring 2 position(s)... (next scan in 45s)
```

### No Change (When Idle)
When no positions are open, bot behaves exactly as before.

## Configuration Presets

Choose based on your trading style:

```env
# Conservative (slower but less API usage)
POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=10
CHECK_INTERVAL=120

# Balanced (recommended default)
POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=5
CHECK_INTERVAL=60

# Aggressive (maximum responsiveness)
POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=3
CHECK_INTERVAL=30

# Day Trading (very active)
POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=2
CHECK_INTERVAL=20
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Will this use more API calls?
**A:** Only when positions are open. When idle, same as before.

### Q: Can I turn this off?
**A:** Yes, set `POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=60` to match the old behavior.

### Q: Do I need to change anything?
**A:** No! Defaults work great. Only customize if you want different timing.

### Q: Will my old settings break?
**A:** No, the bot is 100% backward compatible.

### Q: How much faster is it really?
**A:** 
- Position checks: 60s ‚Üí 5s (12x faster)
- Average reaction time: 30s ‚Üí 2.5s (12x faster)
- Stop loss delays: 0-60s ‚Üí 0-5s (92% improvement)

## Recommended Settings by Account Size

| Balance | POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL | CHECK_INTERVAL | Why? |
|---------|-------------------------|----------------|------|
| < $100 | 10 | 120 | Conservative, learn at slower pace |
| $100-$1000 | 5 | 60 | **Balanced (recommended)** |
| $1000-$10000 | 5 | 45 | Active monitoring |
| > $10000 | 3 | 30 | Maximum responsiveness |

## Example Impact

### Before (Cycle-Based)
```
10:00:00 - Position opens
10:00:05 - Price hits stop loss
10:00:30 - [still sleeping...]
10:01:00 - Bot wakes up, closes position
Result: 55 seconds of extra loss
```

### After (Live Trading)
```
10:00:00 - Position opens
10:00:05 - Price hits stop loss
10:00:10 - Bot closes position
Result: Only 5 seconds of movement
```

**Improvement: 11x faster**

## Troubleshooting

### Too Many Logs?
Set log level to INFO instead of DEBUG:
```env
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
DETAILED_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Want Slower Updates?
Increase the interval:
```env
POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=10  # Check every 10 seconds
```

### API Rate Limits?
Increase both intervals:
```env
POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=10
CHECK_INTERVAL=120
```

## Monitoring

### Check Your Settings
Look for these lines when bot starts:
```
‚è±Ô∏è  Opportunity scan interval: 60s
‚ö° Position update interval: 5s (LIVE MONITORING)
```

### Verify It's Working
When you have positions, you should see:
```
üíì Monitoring X position(s)... (next scan in Ys)
```
Every 5 seconds (or your configured interval).

## Summary

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Position Checks | Every 60s | Every 5s |
| Opportunity Scans | Every 60s | Every 60s |
| Stop Loss Reaction | Slow (0-60s) | Fast (0-5s) |
| API Efficiency | Good | Good (slightly more when active) |

**Bottom line:** Your bot is now truly LIVE and won't miss opportunities! üöÄ
