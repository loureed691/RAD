# P/L Data Fix and Performance Improvements

## Summary
This fix addresses two critical issues in the trading bot:
1. **Incorrect P/L USD calculation** - Fixed a bug where P/L in USD was being calculated incorrectly
2. **Slow trading speed** - Optimized CHECK_INTERVAL and POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL for faster trading

## Bug Fix: P/L USD Calculation

### The Problem
The P/L USD was being calculated incorrectly in `position_manager.py` at two locations (lines 993 and 1102):

```python
# WRONG - dividing by leverage when P/L% already includes leverage
pnl_usd = (pnl / position.leverage) * position_value if position.leverage > 0 else 0
```

### The Root Cause
The `Position.get_pnl()` method already multiplies the price change by leverage:

```python
def get_pnl(self, current_price: float) -> float:
    """Calculate profit/loss percentage"""
    if self.side == 'long':
        pnl = ((current_price - self.entry_price) / self.entry_price) * self.leverage
    else:
        pnl = ((self.entry_price - current_price) / self.entry_price) * self.leverage
    return pnl
```

So the P/L percentage returned already includes the leverage effect. Dividing by leverage again was incorrect.

### Example
**Before fix:**
- Entry: $100, Exit: $105, Leverage: 10x, Position size: 1 contract
- Price gain: 5%
- P/L with leverage: 5% × 10 = 50% (0.50)
- Position value: 1 × $100 = $100
- **Incorrect calculation**: (0.50 / 10) × $100 = **$5** ❌
- **Correct should be**: $50

**After fix:**
- Same scenario
- **Correct calculation**: 0.50 × $100 = **$50** ✅

### The Solution
```python
# CORRECT - P/L% already includes leverage, just multiply by position value
pnl_usd = pnl * position_value
```

### Impact
- **All P/L USD values were being reported 10x too small** (for 10x leverage)
- **All P/L USD values were being reported 20x too small** (for 20x leverage)
- This affected position logging, monitoring, and any P/L-based decisions

## Performance Improvements

### Changes Made
Updated default values in `config.py`:

| Parameter | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| CHECK_INTERVAL | 60s | 30s | 2x faster market scanning |
| POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL | 5s | 3s | 1.67x faster position monitoring |

### Benefits
1. **Faster market scanning**: Bot now scans for opportunities every 30 seconds instead of 60 seconds, allowing it to respond to market conditions twice as fast
2. **Faster position monitoring**: Open positions are checked every 3 seconds instead of 5 seconds, allowing for more responsive trailing stops and exit management
3. **Still within API limits**: These intervals are conservative enough to avoid hitting API rate limits

### Trade-offs
- Slightly higher API usage (but still well within limits)
- Slightly more CPU usage (negligible with current optimization)
- More responsive trading behavior (benefit)

## Testing

### Test Coverage
Created comprehensive test suite in `test_pnl_usd_fix.py`:
- ✅ LONG position with profit (5% price gain, 10x leverage)
- ✅ SHORT position with profit (5% price drop, 10x leverage)
- ✅ LONG position with loss (3% price drop, 10x leverage)
- ✅ Different leverage levels (20x leverage scenario)

All tests passing with 100% success rate.

### Regression Testing
Ran full test suite (`test_trade_simulation.py`):
- ✅ Position Opening
- ✅ P/L Calculation
- ✅ Stop Loss Trigger
- ✅ Take Profit Trigger
- ✅ Trailing Stop
- ✅ Position Closing
- ✅ Risk Management
- ✅ Complete Trade Flow

All 8 tests passing with no regressions.

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
1. **Recalibrate expectations**: If you were seeing unusually small P/L USD values, this fix will show the correct (larger) values
2. **Performance settings**: The bot will now trade faster by default. If you prefer the old behavior, you can override in your `.env` file:
   ```
   CHECK_INTERVAL=60
   POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=5
   ```

### For Developers
- The P/L USD calculation is now correct in both `close_position()` and `update_positions()` methods
- Test suite includes verification of P/L USD calculations
- No API changes - all methods maintain same signatures
