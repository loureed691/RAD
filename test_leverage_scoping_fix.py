Test to verify the leverage scoping bug fix in create_market_order and create_limit_order

    Test that demonstrates the scoping issue and verifies the fix.
    
    The bug was:
    - In nested function _create_order, leverage was assigned (leverage = adjusted_leverage)
    - Python treats variables that are assigned as local to that function
    - This caused UnboundLocalError when trying to use leverage before the assignment
    
    The fix:
    - Add 'nonlocal leverage' at the start of _create_order
    - This tells Python that leverage refers to the outer function's parameter
