2. Detect trend alignment and market regime
3. Generate signal with 26 ML features
4. Check portfolio diversification
5. Analyze order book for entry timing
6. Calculate S/R levels for profit targets
7. Optimize position size with Kelly

```

### Example Trade

**Before Enhancement:**
```
Symbol: BTC/USDT
Signal: BUY
Confidence: 65%
Action: Execute with standard 2% risk
Stop: -3%, Target: +3%
Risk/Reward: 1:1
```

**After Enhancement:**
```
Symbol: BTC/USDT
1h Signal: BUY (65%)
4h Trend: Bullish ✓
1d Trend: Bullish ✓
MTF Boost: +15% → Confidence: 75%
Order Book: Bullish (28% imbalance) ✓
Portfolio: No correlation conflicts ✓
Support: $44,200, Resistance: $46,800
Kelly Risk: 2.1% (optimized)
Stop: $44,110 (below S/R)

## 🎮 Usage

### No Changes Required!
The bot automatically uses all enhancements. Just run:

```bash
python bot.py
```

### Optional Optimization
For maximum benefit, update your `.env`:

```env
MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS=5        # Can handle more now (from 3)
RISK_PER_TRADE=0.015        # Kelly optimizes this (from 0.02)
CHECK_INTERVAL=180          # Less frequent scans needed (from 60)
RETRAIN_INTERVAL=21600      # Retrain every 6 hours (from 24h)
```

**Why these changes?**
- More positions: Better diversification management
- Lower base risk: Kelly adjusts dynamically
- Longer intervals: MTF analysis reduces scan frequency
- More retraining: Faster adaptation
