### Step 1: Verify Your Setup

```

### Step 4: Stop the Bot
Press `Ctrl+C` when done (graceful shutdown).

## 📊 Configuration Settings

Current settings in your `.env`:

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS` | 20 | Max concurrent trades |
| `CHECK_INTERVAL` | 60s | How often to scan markets |
| `POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL` | 3s | Position monitoring speed |
| `MAX_WORKERS` | 20 | Parallel market scanners |

### Auto-Configured (Based on Balance):
- **Leverage** - Automatically optimized
- **Position Size** - Calculated as % of balance
- **Risk Per Trade** - 1-3% depending on balance
- **Profit Threshold** - Includes trading fees

**Tip:** These smart defaults are optimal for most traders. Only override if you have specific requirements!

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Beginners:
1. Start with `MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS=3` to test
2. Monitor logs closely for first few hours
3. Let the bot auto-configure based on your balance

### For Advanced Users:
1. Review risk settings in `.env`
2. Adjust `CHECK_INTERVAL` for faster/slower scanning
3. Increase `MAX_WORKERS` for faster market analysis (if you have the API rate limit headroom)

### Risk Management:
- The bot uses Kelly Criterion for position sizing
- Dynamic leverage based on confidence and volatility
- Trailing stops protect profits automatically
- Stop losses prevent large drawdowns
