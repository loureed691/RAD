# Smart Trading & Leverage Strategy Enhancements

This document details the major enhancements made to create a significantly smarter trading and leverage strategy system.

## Overview

The trading bot has been upgraded with:
- **Intelligent Multi-Factor Leverage System**: Considers 8 different factors for optimal leverage selection (3x-20x range)
- **Adaptive Fractional Kelly Criterion**: Dynamically adjusts position sizing based on recent performance consistency
- **Performance Streak Tracking**: Leverages win/loss streak data to adjust risk appropriately
- **Volatility Regime Classification**: 7-tier volatility classification for more precise leverage selection
- **Enhanced Drawdown Protection**: Stronger protection during severe drawdowns

---

## 1. Enhanced Leverage Strategy

### Previous System
- **Simple 2-factor approach**: Only considered volatility and confidence
- **Limited range**: 3x to 15x leverage
- **Static adjustments**: ±2x for confidence only

### New Smart System
The leverage calculation now considers **8 independent factors** with individual adjustments:

#### Factor 1: Volatility Regime Classification
7-tier classification for more precise base leverage:

| Volatility | Regime | Base Leverage |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| <1%        | Very Low | 16x |
| 1-2%       | Low | 14x |
| 2-3%       | Normal | 11x |
| 3-5%       | Medium | 8x |
| 5-8%       | High | 6x |
| 8-10%      | Very High | 4x |
| >10%       | Extreme | 3x |

#### Factor 2: Signal Confidence (±3x)
- ≥80% confidence: +3x (exceptional signals)
- ≥75% confidence: +2x (very high confidence)
- ≥65% confidence: +1x (good confidence)
- ≥55% confidence: 0x (acceptable)
- <55% confidence: -2x (reduce leverage)

#### Factor 3: Momentum (±2x)
- |momentum| > 3%: +2x (strong momentum)
- |momentum| > 2%: +1x (good momentum)
- |momentum| < 0.5%: -1x (weak momentum)

#### Factor 4: Trend Strength (±2x)
- Trend strength > 70%: +2x (strong trend)
- Trend strength > 50%: +1x (moderate trend)
- Trend strength < 30%: -1x (weak/no trend)

#### Factor 5: Market Regime (±2x)
- Trending market: +2x (can be aggressive in trends)
- Neutral market: 0x (baseline)
- Ranging market: -2x (more conservative)

#### Factor 6: Win/Loss Streak (±3x)
- Win streak ≥5: +2x (hot streak)
- Win streak ≥3: +1x (performing well)
- Loss streak ≥4: -3x (cold streak - significant reduction)
- Loss streak ≥2: -2x (concerning pattern)

#### Factor 7: Recent Performance (±2x)
Based on last 10 trades:
- Recent win rate ≥70%: +2x (excellent recent performance)
- Recent win rate ≥60%: +1x (good recent performance)
- Recent win rate ≤30%: -2x (poor recent performance)
- Recent win rate ≤40%: -1x (below average)

#### Factor 8: Drawdown Protection (overrides others)
**Most Important** - takes precedence:
- Drawdown >20%: -10x (severe protection)
- Drawdown 15-20%: -6x (moderate protection)
- Drawdown 10-15%: -3x (light protection)

### Calculation Example

**Optimal Conditions:**
```
Base (low vol, 1.5%): 14x
+ Confidence (85%): +3x
+ Momentum (3.5%): +2x
+ Trend (75%): +2x
+ Regime (trending): +2x
+ Win Streak (5): +2x
+ Recent (70% win): +2x
+ Drawdown (0%): 0x
= 27x → capped at 20x maximum
```

**Poor Conditions:**
```
Base (high vol, 9%): 4x
+ Confidence (58%): 0x
+ Momentum (0.3%): -1x
+ Trend (25%): -1x
+ Regime (ranging): -2x
+ Loss Streak (4): -3x
+ Recent (30% win): -2x
+ Drawdown (25%): -10x
= -15x → floored at 3x minimum
```

**Real-World Mixed:**
```
Base (normal vol, 2.5%): 11x
+ Confidence (72%): +1x
+ Momentum (2.2%): +1x
+ Trend (60%): +1x
+ Regime (neutral): 0x
+ No streak: 0x
+ Recent (55% win): 0x
+ Drawdown (8%): 0x
= 14x leverage
```

## 2. Enhanced Kelly Criterion

### Previous System
- **Fixed half-Kelly (0.5)**: Always used 50% of optimal Kelly
- **Cap**: 0.5% to 3.0%
- **No performance tracking**: Didn't consider recent consistency

### New Adaptive System

#### Fractional Kelly Adjustment
The fraction of Kelly used (previously fixed at 0.5) now adapts based on performance consistency:

```python
performance_consistency = 1.0 - abs(recent_win_rate - historical_win_rate)

if consistency > 0.85:    # Very consistent
    fraction = 0.6        # 60% Kelly (more aggressive)
elif consistency > 0.70:  # Good consistency
    fraction = 0.55       # 55% Kelly
elif consistency < 0.50:  # Very inconsistent
    fraction = 0.4        # 40% Kelly (more conservative)
elif consistency < 0.60:  # Below average
    fraction = 0.45       # 45% Kelly
else:
    fraction = 0.5        # Standard half-Kelly
```

#### Streak Adjustments
Further modifies the fractional Kelly:

**Loss Streak Reduction:**
- 3+ losses: × 0.7 (30% reduction)
- 2+ losses: × 0.85 (15% reduction)

**Win Streak Boost (capped):**
- 5+ wins: × 1.1 (10% increase, max 65% Kelly)
- 3+ wins: × 1.05 (5% increase, max 65% Kelly)

#### Enhanced Cap
- Increased from **3.0% to 3.5%** for better optimization potential
- Minimum remains at 0.5%

### Calculation Examples

**Consistent Performance (recent 60% vs historical 58%):**
```
Kelly fraction: 16% (from win rate and profit/loss ratio)
Consistency: 98% → use 0.6 fractional Kelly
Adjusted: 16% × 0.6 = 9.6%
Capped at: 3.5%
```

**Inconsistent Performance (recent 30% vs historical 58%):**
```
Kelly fraction: 16%
Consistency: 72% → use 0.55 fractional Kelly
Adjusted: 16% × 0.55 = 8.8%
Capped at: 3.5%
```

**During 3-Loss Streak:**
```
Kelly fraction: 16%
Consistency: 50% → use 0.5 fractional Kelly
Loss streak adjustment: × 0.7
Adjusted: 16% × 0.5 × 0.7 = 5.6%
Capped at: 3.5%
```

## 3. Performance Tracking System

### New Components

#### Streak Tracking
```python
win_streak: int       # Current consecutive wins
loss_streak: int      # Current consecutive losses
recent_trades: list   # Rolling window of last 10 trades
```

#### Methods
- `record_trade_outcome(pnl)`: Records win/loss and updates streaks
- `get_recent_win_rate()`: Calculates win rate from recent trades

### Integration
Called automatically when positions close:
```python
# In bot.py after position closes
self.risk_manager.record_trade_outcome(pnl)
```

## 8. Advanced Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Recovery from Drawdown
```
Initial: 20% drawdown, 4-loss streak
Leverage: Base 11x - 10 (drawdown) - 3 (streak) = 3x (minimum)
Kelly: Reduced to ~1.0% (vs normal 2.5%)

After 3 wins and <10% drawdown:
Leverage: Base 11x - 3 (drawdown) + 1 (streak) = 9x
Kelly: Back to ~2.0%

After recovery (0% drawdown, 5-win streak):
Leverage: Base 11x + 2 (streak) = 13x
Kelly: Increased to ~2.8%
```

### Scenario 2: Strong Trending Market
```
Conditions: Low volatility (1.5%), trending market, high confidence (82%)
Base leverage: 14x
+ Confidence: +3x
+ Trend strength (75%): +2x
+ Market regime (trending): +2x
+ Momentum (3.2%): +2x
= 23x → capped at 20x

Kelly: With 65% win rate, 60% fractional = 3.2% position size
Result: Maximum safe aggression for optimal conditions
```

### Scenario 3: Choppy Ranging Market
```
Conditions: Medium volatility (4%), ranging market, moderate confidence (68%)
Base leverage: 8x
+ Confidence: +1x
+ Trend strength (25%): -1x
+ Market regime (ranging): -2x
+ Momentum (0.8%): -1x
= 5x

Kelly: With inconsistent performance (40% recent vs 60% historical):
45% fractional → 2.0% position size
Result: Conservative approach for unfavorable conditions
```
