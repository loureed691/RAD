## Key Innovations

### 1. Market Regime Awareness
The bot now continuously monitors market conditions and classifies them into 5 regimes:
- **Bull**: Strong uptrend + high volume → +15% aggressive
- **Bear**: Strong downtrend + high volume → -25% defensive
- **Neutral**: Range-bound → standard sizing
- **High Vol**: Chaotic market → -35% very defensive
- **Low Vol**: Calm market → +5% slightly aggressive

### 2. Intelligent Position Sizing
Position sizing now adapts to:
- Market regime (bull/bear/neutral/high_vol/low_vol)
- Signal confidence (0-1 scale)
- Historical performance (Kelly Criterion)
- Current portfolio heat (risk concentration)
- Market liquidity (order book depth)

### 3. Order Flow Intelligence
Before each trade, the bot analyzes:
- Order book imbalance (buying vs selling pressure)
- Market depth (top 10 levels)
- Spread width (execution cost)
- Liquidity score (4 components)
- Optimal entry timing

### 4. Strategy Adaptation
4 distinct strategies, each optimized for specific conditions:
- **Trend Following**: Rides strong trends (best in bull/bear)
- **Mean Reversion**: Trades extremes (best in ranging markets)
- **Breakout**: Catches consolidation breaks (best in low vol)
- **Momentum**: Acceleration moves (best in strong trends)

Bot automatically switches strategies every 6+ hours based on regime.

### 5. Professional Metrics
Institutional-grade performance tracking:
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Measures risk-adjusted returns (target: 2.0+)
- **Sortino Ratio**: Focuses on downside risk
- **Calmar Ratio**: Return vs max drawdown
- **Profit Factor**: Gross profit / gross loss (target: 2.5+)
