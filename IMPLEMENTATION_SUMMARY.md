## Monitoring

Watch for these indicators in logs:

**Leverage Breakdown:**
```
Leverage calculation: base=11x (normal vol), conf=+1, mom=+1, 
  trend=+1, regime=0, streak=+2, recent=+1, drawdown=0 ‚Üí 17x
```

**Kelly Optimization:**
```
Using Kelly-optimized risk: 2.8% (consistency: 94%, fraction: 0.6)
```

**Protection Alerts:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è High drawdown detected: 25.0% - Reducing risk to 50%
üìâ 4-loss streak detected - Reducing leverage by 3x
```

**Positive Signals:**
```
üìà 5-win streak - Increasing Kelly by 10%
üöÄ Optimal conditions detected - Using 18x leverage
```

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Leverage Decision Example

**Before (2 factors):**
```python
if volatility > 0.05:
    base = 5
elif volatility > 0.03:
    base = 7
else:
    base = 10

if confidence >= 0.75:
    leverage = base + 2
else:
    leverage = base

# Result: 5-12x range, limited intelligence
```

**After (8 factors):**
```python
# 7-tier volatility base (3-16x)
# + Confidence (¬±3x)
# + Momentum (¬±2x)
# + Trend (¬±2x)
# + Market regime (¬±2x)
# + Win/loss streak (¬±3x)
# + Recent performance (¬±2x)
# + Drawdown (-10x protection)

# Result: 3-20x range, highly intelligent
```
