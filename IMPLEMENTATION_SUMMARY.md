python bot.py
```

### Optional Optimization

For maximum performance, update `.env`:

```env
MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS=5        # Better diversification
RISK_PER_TRADE=0.015        # Lower base (volatility adjusts)
CHECK_INTERVAL=180          # Sophisticated analysis
RETRAIN_INTERVAL=21600      # Faster adaptation
MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.55         # Lower (adaptive threshold handles)
```
