# API Rate Limiting - Quick Reference

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
- **ccxt default**: 75ms delay = 800 calls/min ❌ (exceeds KuCoin's 240 calls/min limit)
- **Order operations**: Multiple rapid API calls without throttling ❌
- **Risk**: HTTP 429 errors, failed orders, missed position updates ❌

### Solution
- **ccxt override**: 250ms delay = 240 calls/min ✅ (matches KuCoin limit)
- **Global tracking**: Thread-safe rate limiting across all operations ✅
- **Explicit throttling**: 250ms enforced between every API call ✅

## Key Changes

### 1. Rate Limit Override
```python
# In kucoin_client.py __init__
self.exchange.rateLimit = 250  # Was 75ms, now 250ms
```

### 2. Global Rate Enforcement
```python
# New method in kucoin_client.py
def _enforce_rate_limit(self):
    """Enforce 250ms minimum between ANY API calls"""
    # Thread-safe global tracking
    # Automatic sleep if needed
```

### 3. Applied to All Operations
- ✅ Position monitoring: `get_open_positions()`
- ✅ Market orders: `create_market_order()`
- ✅ Limit orders: `create_limit_order()`
- ✅ Stop orders: `create_stop_limit_order()`
- ✅ Cancel orders: `cancel_order()`
- ✅ Market scanning: `get_ticker()`, `get_ohlcv()`

## Performance Impact

| Operation | Before | After | Impact |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Position check | 1 call/sec | 1 call/sec | No change |
| Market order | ~100ms | ~1000ms | +900ms (safer) |
| Limit order | ~75ms | ~750ms | +675ms (safer) |
| Market scan | 1 scan/60s | 1 scan/60s | No change |

**Trade-off**: Slightly slower orders (~1 second) for guaranteed API safety.

## Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
python test_rate_limit_improvements.py  # 5 tests
python test_improved_api_handling.py    # 5 tests
```

### Expected Results
```
✅ All 10 tests passing
✅ Rate limit: 250ms enforced
✅ Max: 4 calls/sec = 240 calls/min
✅ Thread-safe across concurrent operations
```

## Monitoring

### Startup Logs
```
✅ Rate Limit Override: 250ms between calls (4 calls/sec max)
✅ API Call Priority System: ENABLED
```

### Watch For
- ✅ No HTTP 429 errors
- ✅ All orders execute successfully
- ✅ Position updates complete without errors

## Configuration

### No Changes Needed
All fixes are automatic - no configuration required.

### Optional: More Conservative
```python
# kucoin_client.py (if still getting 429 errors)
self._min_call_interval = 0.3  # 300ms = even safer
```

### Optional: Reduce API Usage
```env
# .env (reduce position monitoring frequency)
POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=2.0  # Check every 2s instead of 1s
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 429 Errors?
1. Increase `_min_call_interval` to 0.3 (300ms)
2. Increase `POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL` to 2.0
3. Increase `CHECK_INTERVAL` to 90 (scan every 90s)

### Orders Too Slow?
This is expected and by design. Each order now takes ~1 second with proper rate limiting.

**Do NOT** reduce `_min_call_interval` below 250ms - this risks rate limiting.

## Summary

### Before
- 🔴 Risk of exceeding API limits
- 🔴 Potential HTTP 429 errors
- 🔴 Failed orders during bursts
- 🔴 Unthrottled rapid calls

### After
- ✅ Never exceed 4 calls/second
- ✅ Never exceed 240 calls/minute
- ✅ Thread-safe enforcement
- ✅ Guaranteed API safety

**Result**: The bot is now fully protected against API rate limiting issues! 🚀
