## Feature Validation

### New Features ✅

#### 1. Auto-Configuration from Balance
**Status:** ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY

The bot automatically configures trading parameters based on account balance:

| $100-$1,000 | 7x | 1.5% | Conservative for small accounts |
| $1,000-$10,000 | 10x | 2.0% | Balanced for medium accounts |
| $10,000-$100,000 | 12x | 2.5% | Moderate-aggressive for large accounts |
| $100,000+ | 15x | 3.0% | Aggressive for very large accounts |

**Min Profit Thresholds:**
- Micro accounts (<$100): 0.8% (covers fees better)
- Small accounts (<$1,000): 0.6%
- Medium+ accounts: 0.5%

**Max Position Size:**
- Micro accounts: 30% of balance (min $10)
