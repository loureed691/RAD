# Quick Start Guide - Testing the Fix

## What Was Fixed

This PR fixes two critical KuCoin API errors:

1. **Error 330011**: "The order's position mode does not match your selected mode"
2. **Error 100001**: "Quantity cannot exceed 10,000"

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Run All Tests

```bash
# Run original test suite
python test_bot.py

# Run verification script
python verify_position_mode_fix.py

# Run unit tests
python test_position_mode_fix.py
```

All tests should pass with green checkmarks ✓

### 2. Test with Your Bot

When you run your bot with live KuCoin credentials, you should see:

**On Initialization:**
```
INFO - KuCoin Futures client initialized successfully
INFO - Set position mode to ONE_WAY (hedged=False)
```

**When Creating Orders:**
```
DEBUG - Calculated position size: 34035.4014 contracts ($65.86 value)
WARNING - Amount 34035.4014 exceeds maximum 10000, capping to 10000
INFO - Created buy order for 10000.0 AKE/USDT:USDT at 10x leverage
```

### 3. What to Look For

#### Success Indicators ✅
- No more 330011 errors
- No more 100001 errors  
- Warning messages when position sizes are capped
- Orders successfully created

#### Warning Messages (Normal)
These are expected and indicate the fix is working:
```
WARNING - Amount 34035.4014 exceeds maximum 10000, capping to 10000
WARNING - Could not set position mode: ... (only if exchange doesn't support)
```

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Before Fix
- Bot would crash on every order attempt
- Error 330011: Position mode mismatch
- Error 100001: Quantity exceeds 10,000

### After Fix
- Bot initializes with ONE_WAY position mode
- Large position sizes automatically capped at 10,000 contracts
- Orders created successfully
- Clear warning logs when adjustments are made

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see Error 330011:
1. Check that `set_position_mode(hedged=False)` is being called in logs
2. Verify you're using the updated `kucoin_client.py`
3. Restart the bot to ensure initialization runs

### If you still see Error 100001:
1. Check that you see "Amount ... exceeds maximum ... capping" warnings
2. Verify the validated_amount is being used in order creation
3. Check that `validate_and_cap_amount()` method exists

### If tests fail:
```bash
# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.11+

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests individually
python test_bot.py
python verify_position_mode_fix.py
python test_position_mode_fix.py
```
