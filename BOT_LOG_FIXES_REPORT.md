# Bot Log Analysis and Fixes - Summary Report

## Date: 2025-10-26

## Issues Identified in bot.log

### 1. Rate Limiting (Primary Issue)
- **Occurrences**: 134 rate limit errors
- **Error Message**: `kucoinfutures {"code":"429000","msg":"Too many requests. User-level rate limit exceeded."}`
- **Impact**: Failed API calls, degraded performance, circuit breaker activation

### 2. Circuit Breaker Activation
- **Occurrences**: 1 activation
- **Trigger**: 5 consecutive API failures
- **Message**: `ðŸš¨ CIRCUIT BREAKER ACTIVATED after 5 consecutive failures`
- **Impact**: 60-second cooldown period, halted market scanning

### 3. Slow Scans
- **Occurrences**: 11 scans exceeding threshold
- **Duration Range**: 33-59 seconds (threshold: 30s)
- **Impact**: Delayed opportunity detection, resource inefficiency

### 4. Root Cause Analysis
The bot was configured too aggressively:
- 20 parallel workers scanning the market
- Scanning every 60 seconds
- No delays between API calls
- Insufficient backoff on rate limit errors

This resulted in burst API requests that exceeded KuCoin's rate limits.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Configuration Changes (config.py)

#### MAX_WORKERS Reduction
```python
# Before:
MAX_WORKERS = int(os.getenv('MAX_WORKERS', '20'))

# After:
MAX_WORKERS = int(os.getenv('MAX_WORKERS', '10'))  # Reduced from 20 to 10 to prevent rate limiting
```
- **Impact**: 50% reduction in parallel API requests

#### CHECK_INTERVAL Increase
```python
# Before:
CHECK_INTERVAL = int(os.getenv('CHECK_INTERVAL', '60'))

# After:
CHECK_INTERVAL = int(os.getenv('CHECK_INTERVAL', '90'))  # Increased from 60 to reduce API rate limiting
```
- **Impact**: 50% longer time between scans (33.3% reduction in scan frequency)

#### API_CALL_DELAY Addition
```python
# New configuration:
API_CALL_DELAY = float(os.getenv('API_CALL_DELAY', '0.1'))  # Delay between parallel API calls to prevent rate limiting (seconds)
```
- **Impact**: Adds spacing between API calls to prevent bursts

### 2. Rate Limit Handling Improvements (kucoin_client.py)

#### Exponential Backoff Enhancement
```python
# Before:
delay = (2 ** attempt)  # 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s...

# After:
delay = min((3 ** attempt), 60)  # 3s, 9s, 27s, 60s
```
- **Impact**: More aggressive backoff to give API time to recover

#### Base Delay Increase
```python
# Before:
delay = 1  # or 2 seconds

# After:
delay = 5  # 5 seconds
```
- **Impact**: Longer initial wait time before retry

#### Cooldown After Retry Exhaustion
```python
# New code:
time.sleep(30)  # 30s cooldown after exhausting all retries
```
- **Impact**: Prevents immediate retry bursts after failures

#### Circuit Breaker Timeout Increase
```python
# Before:
self._circuit_breaker_timeout = 60

# After:
self._circuit_breaker_timeout = 120  # Increased from 60 to 120 seconds
```
- **Impact**: Longer recovery period before resuming after circuit breaker

### 3. Market Scanner Improvements (market_scanner.py)

#### Staggered Task Submission
```python
# Before:
future_to_symbol = {
    executor.submit(self.scan_pair, symbol): symbol 
    for symbol in filtered_symbols
}

# After:
future_to_symbol = {}
api_call_delay = getattr(Config, 'API_CALL_DELAY', 0.1)
for i, symbol in enumerate(filtered_symbols):
    future = executor.submit(self.scan_pair, symbol)
    future_to_symbol[future] = symbol
    if (i + 1) % max_workers == 0 and api_call_delay > 0:
        time.sleep(api_call_delay * max_workers)
```
- **Impact**: Prevents all workers from starting simultaneously

#### Delays Between API Calls in scan_pair
```python
# New code:
api_call_delay = getattr(Config, 'API_CALL_DELAY', 0.1)
if api_call_delay > 0:
    time.sleep(api_call_delay)
```
- **Impact**: Spaces out the 3 API calls per pair (1h, 4h, 1d data)

## Expected Results

### Request Rate Reduction
- **Worker Reduction**: 50% (from 20 to 10)
- **Frequency Reduction**: 33.3% (from 60s to 90s intervals = 1.5x longer)
- **Overall Request Rate**: ~66.7% reduction (0.5 Ã— 0.667 = 0.333x of original rate)

### Rate Limit Error Reduction
- **Expected**: 70-80% reduction in rate limit errors
- **Mechanism**: Combination of fewer workers, longer intervals, and better backoff

### Scan Performance
- **Expected Scan Time**: 35-40 seconds (previously 33-59s)
- **Additional Delay**: ~5-10 seconds from API_CALL_DELAY
- **Still Under Threshold**: Should now consistently stay under reasonable limits

### Reliability Improvements
- **Circuit Breaker**: Significantly reduced likelihood of activation
- **API Quota Management**: Better distribution of API calls over time
- **Error Recovery**: More graceful handling with longer cooldowns

## Validation

All changes have been verified:
- âœ… MAX_WORKERS = 10 (config.py:62)
- âœ… CHECK_INTERVAL = 90 (config.py:57)
- âœ… API_CALL_DELAY = 0.1 (config.py:65)
- âœ… Exponential backoff uses 3^n (kucoin_client.py:275, 371)
- âœ… Circuit breaker timeout = 120s (kucoin_client.py:71)
- âœ… Scanner adds delays between API calls (market_scanner.py)

## Recommendations for Monitoring

1. **Monitor Rate Limit Errors**: Should drop to <20 per day (from ~134)
2. **Monitor Scan Times**: Should stabilize around 35-40 seconds
3. **Monitor Circuit Breaker**: Should have zero activations
4. **Monitor Opportunities Found**: Should remain consistent despite longer intervals

## Configuration Override Options

Users can override these settings via environment variables:
```bash
export MAX_WORKERS=15         # Increase if needed (max 20)
export CHECK_INTERVAL=120     # Increase for even less aggressive scanning
export API_CALL_DELAY=0.2     # Increase for more spacing between calls
```

## Testing

The fixes can be validated by running:
```bash
# Check configuration values
grep "MAX_WORKERS\|CHECK_INTERVAL\|API_CALL_DELAY" config.py

# Check rate limit handling
grep "3 \*\* attempt\|circuit_breaker_timeout = 120" kucoin_client.py

# Check scanner delays
grep "time.sleep(api_call_delay)" market_scanner.py
```

## Conclusion

The implemented fixes address the root causes of the rate limiting issues:
1. Reduced parallel request volume
2. Increased time between scans
3. Added spacing between individual API calls
4. Improved error handling and backoff strategies
5. Extended recovery periods

These changes should result in a more stable and reliable bot operation while maintaining effective market scanning capabilities.
