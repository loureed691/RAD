## 💡 Smart Decision Examples

### Example 1: Optimal Trade

**Before:**
```
Signal: BUY ETHUSDT
Confidence: 0.70
Action: Execute 100 contracts at market
Stop: 3% below entry
```

**After:**
```
Signal: BUY ETHUSDT
Base Confidence: 0.70

Enhancements:
✅ MTF confluence: bullish across 1h/4h/1d → +15% confidence
✅ Order book timing: excellent (0.85 score) → +10% confidence
✅ Low correlation with BTC position (0.3) → Full size
✅ Bayesian Kelly: 0.32 fraction (high confidence)

Final Decision:
- Adjusted Confidence: 0.87 (excellent!)
- Entry: Limit order at slightly better price
- Size: Full position (no correlation penalty)
- Stops: 3 levels (initial, trailing, profit-based)
- Exits: Partial at 1R (30%), 2R (40%), 3.5R (30%)
```

### Example 2: Protected Trade

**Before:**
```
Signal: BUY SOLUSDT
Confidence: 0.65
Action: Execute 100 contracts at market
Stop: 3% below entry
```

**After:**
```
Signal: BUY SOLUSDT
Base Confidence: 0.65

Risk Checks:
⚠️  MTF divergence: 1h bullish but 4h bearish → -10% confidence
⚠️  Poor order book timing (0.35 score) → -10% confidence
⚠️  High correlation with AVAX (0.75) → -30% size reduction
❌ Category concentration: Already 65% in L1 → BLOCKED

Final Decision:
- TRADE BLOCKED: Concentration limit exceeded
- Reason: Too much exposure to L1 blockchains
- Recommended: Wait for better diversification
```

### Example 3: Scaled Entry

**Before:**
```
Signal: BUY BTCUSDT
Confidence: 0.60
Volatility: 8% (high)
Action: Execute 100 contracts at market
```

**After:**
```
Signal: BUY BTCUSDT
Base Confidence: 0.60
Volatility: 8% (very high)

Smart Adjustments:
⚠️  High volatility → Scale entry
⚠️  Moderate timing score (0.55)
✅ Good MTF alignment

Final Decision:
- Entry 1: 50 contracts at market (50%)
- Entry 2: 30 contracts at -0.8% (30%)
- Entry 3: 20 contracts at -1.5% (20%)
- Rationale: Reduce timing risk in volatile market
- Dynamic stop: Wider due to volatility (4.5% vs 3%)
```
