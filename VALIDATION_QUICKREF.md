## Quick Health Check

Run this to verify bot is working:

```bash
python test_small_balance_support.py
```

Should see:
```
✅ All tests passed! Bot is working correctly.
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail
1. Check dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Check Python version: 3.8+
3. Review error messages in test output
4. Check logs/ directory for detailed errors

### If Bot Won't Start
1. Verify .env file exists with API credentials
2. Check minimum balance ($1 USDT)
3. Review logs/bot.log for initialization errors
4. Ensure API credentials are valid

## Production Checklist

Before running with real money:

- [ ] All tests pass (run test_small_balance_support.py)
- [ ] API credentials set in .env
- [ ] Start with small balance ($10-50)
- [ ] Monitor logs regularly
- [ ] Set CLOSE_POSITIONS_ON_SHUTDOWN=true
- [ ] Understand auto-configuration settings
- [ ] Review VALIDATION_REPORT.md

## Support

If issues arise:
1. Check VALIDATION_REPORT.md for detailed information
2. Review test output for specific failures
3. Check logs/ directory for runtime errors
4. Verify balance is above minimum ($1)
