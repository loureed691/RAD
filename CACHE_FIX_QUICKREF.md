# Cache Behavior Fix - Quick Reference

## Issue Fixed
"i only want to use cached data if the real data is not available sostandart should be live data"

## Solution
✅ **Live data is now standard** - Cache is only used as fallback when live data fails

---

## Key Changes

### market_scanner.py

#### scan_pair() Method
```python
# OLD BEHAVIOR ❌
if cache is fresh:
    return cache  # Returns stale data!

# NEW BEHAVIOR ✅
try:
    fetch live data
    return live data  # Always fresh!
except:
    if cache available:
        return cache  # Only as fallback
```

#### scan_all_pairs() Method
```python
# OLD BEHAVIOR ❌
if cached scan is fresh:
    return cached scan

# NEW BEHAVIOR ✅
try:
    fetch live futures
    scan live
    return live results
except:
    if cached scan available:
        return cached scan  # Only as fallback
```

---

## When Cache Is Used

Cache fallback occurs **ONLY** when:
- Exchange API unavailable
- Network errors
- Insufficient data from API
- Data quality issues
- Any exception during live fetch

---

## Testing

```bash
# Run the cache fallback tests
python3 test_cache_fallback.py

# Run existing tests
python3 test_bot.py
```

All tests pass ✅

---

## Monitoring

Look for these log messages:

**Normal Operation:**
```
Starting market scan with live data...
Fetching OHLCV data...
```

**Fallback Mode:**
```
No OHLCV data for BTC/USDT:USDT, checking cache...
Using cached data as fallback for BTC/USDT:USDT (age: 120s)
```

---

## Benefits

1. **Better Decisions** - Always uses current market data
2. **Faster Response** - Reacts to real-time market changes
3. **Maintained Reliability** - Cache provides safety net
4. **No Breaking Changes** - Fully backward compatible

---

## Example

**Market drops at 10:02 AM:**

| Time | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| 10:00 | Fetch live: BUY | Fetch live: BUY |
| 10:02 | Return cache: BUY ❌ | Fetch live: SELL ✅ |

**Result:** New behavior sees the drop and adjusts!
