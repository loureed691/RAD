## üîß How It Works

### Market Regime Detection

The bot continuously analyzes:
- **Price Trends**: Linear regression on recent prices
- **Volatility**: Annualized standard deviation of returns
- **Volume**: Recent vs average volume ratios

Regimes:
- **Bull**: Strong uptrend + high volume
- **Bear**: Strong downtrend + high volume
- **Neutral**: Weak/no trend
- **High Vol**: Volatility > 60% annualized
- **Low Vol**: Volatility < 20% annualized

### Strategy Selection Logic

```python
# Example: Bull market with high confidence
if market_regime == 'bull':
    selected_strategy = 'trend_following'
    kelly_multiplier = 1.15  # Slightly more aggressive
    
# Example: High volatility market
elif market_regime == 'high_vol':
    selected_strategy = 'mean_reversion'
    kelly_multiplier = 0.65  # Very conservative
```

### Risk Management Flow

1. **Detect Market Regime** ‚Üí Classify current market state
2. **Calculate Portfolio Heat** ‚Üí Measure concentration risk
3. **Check Liquidity** ‚Üí Ensure sufficient market depth
4. **Analyze Order Book** ‚Üí Identify buying/selling pressure
5. **Select Strategy** ‚Üí Choose best strategy for conditions
6. **Calculate Position Size** ‚Üí Regime-aware Kelly criterion
7. **Set Dynamic Stops** ‚Üí ATR + support/resistance based
8. **Execute Trade** ‚Üí With optimal timing
9. **Monitor Performance** ‚Üí Track Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar

## üéì Key Concepts

### Kelly Criterion
Optimal position sizing formula: `f = (bp - q) / b`
- Where: `b` = win/loss ratio, `p` = win probability, `q` = loss probability
- 2026 Enhancement: Adjusted for market regime and signal confidence

### Market Regime
Current market state determines:
- Strategy selection (which strategy to use)
- Kelly multiplier (how aggressive to be)
- Confidence threshold (how selective to be)
- Stop loss width (how much room to give)

### Portfolio Heat
Risk concentration metric (0-100):
- **0-40**: Low risk, open to new positions
- **40-70**: Moderate risk, selective on new positions
- **70-80**: High risk, very selective
- **80+**: Excessive risk, no new positions

### Sharpe Ratio
Risk-adjusted return metric:
- **< 1.0**: Poor risk-adjusted returns
- **1.0-2.0**: Good risk-adjusted returns
- **2.0-3.0**: Excellent risk-adjusted returns
- **> 3.0**: Outstanding (institutional grade)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All 2026 features work automatically with existing configuration. Optional tuning:

### Risk Tolerance
```env
# Conservative (recommended for new users)
RISK_PER_TRADE=0.01
MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS=2
LEVERAGE=5

# Balanced (recommended for most users)
RISK_PER_TRADE=0.02
MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS=3
LEVERAGE=8

# Aggressive (for experienced users)
RISK_PER_TRADE=0.03
MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS=5
LEVERAGE=12
```

### Portfolio Heat Limits
The bot uses:
- Max Portfolio Heat: 80.0 (hard limit)
- Caution at: 70.0
- Comfortable at: < 60.0

### Kelly Fraction
The bot uses:
- Base: 0.25 (25% of full Kelly - conservative)
- Bull market: 0.25 * 1.15 = 0.2875
- Bear market: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875
- High volatility: 0.25 * 0.65 = 0.1625

- $1M+ daily volume
- Spread < 0.2%
- Order book depth > $10k in top 10 levels

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Portfolio heat too high"
**Cause**: Too many open positions or high leverage  
**Solution**: Close some positions or reduce leverage

### "Confidence too low"
**Cause**: Signal doesn't meet regime-specific threshold  
**Solution**: Bot is being selective (this is good!)

### "Insufficient liquidity"
**Cause**: Market has low volume or wide spreads  
**Solution**: Bot avoids illiquid markets (this prevents losses)

### Strategy switches frequently
**Cause**: Market regime is unstable  
**Solution**: Normal in choppy markets, bot requires 6h minimum between switches
