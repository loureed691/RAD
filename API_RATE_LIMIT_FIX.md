# API Rate Limit Fix

## Problem Statement

The trading bot was at risk of hitting KuCoin's API rate limits due to:
1. **Incorrect ccxt rate limit**: Default 75ms delay (allows 800 calls/min) exceeded KuCoin's actual limit (240 calls/min)
2. **Unthrottled order operations**: Multiple sequential API calls within order creation without proper throttling
3. **Concurrent operations**: Position monitoring and market scanning could make simultaneous calls

## KuCoin API Rate Limits

**Official Limits:**
- **Private Endpoints**: 40 calls per 10 seconds
- **Equivalent**: 240 calls per minute
- **Maximum Safe Rate**: 4 calls per second

**What Happens on Limit Exceeded:**
- HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) errors
- Temporary API access suspension
- Failed order placements
- Missed position monitoring updates

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: ccxt Default Rate Limit Too Low

```python
# BEFORE (in ccxt)
self.exchange.rateLimit = 75  # 75ms between calls
# Allows: 13.3 calls/second = 800 calls/minute ‚ùå UNSAFE!
```

**Impact**: Even with `enableRateLimit=True`, calls were being made too frequently.

### Issue 2: Multiple Rapid API Calls in Order Creation

Each order operation made 4-5 sequential API calls:

```python
# Order creation sequence (BEFORE)
ticker = self.get_ticker(symbol)              # API call 1
self.exchange.set_margin_mode('cross')        # API call 2 (UNTHROTTLED)
self.exchange.set_leverage(10)                # API call 3 (UNTHROTTLED)
order = self.exchange.create_order(...)       # API call 4 (UNTHROTTLED)
filled = self.exchange.fetch_order(order_id)  # API call 5 (UNTHROTTLED)
```

**Impact**: 5 calls in rapid succession (only first call was rate-limited by ccxt)

### Issue 3: Concurrent Thread Operations

Two threads making simultaneous calls:
- **Position Monitor**: Checking positions every 1 second (60 calls/min)
- **Market Scanner**: Scanning market every 60 seconds (~20-30 calls/min)

**Impact**: Without global rate limiting, both threads could make calls simultaneously.

## Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: Override ccxt Rate Limit to Safe Value

```python
# kucoin_client.py __init__
self.exchange = ccxt.kucoinfutures({
    'apiKey': api_key,
    'secret': api_secret,
    'password': api_passphrase,
    'enableRateLimit': True,
})

# Override ccxt's 75ms with KuCoin's actual safe limit
self.exchange.rateLimit = 250  # 250ms = 4 calls/sec = 240 calls/min ‚úÖ
```

**Result**: ccxt's internal rate limiting now matches KuCoin's actual limits.

### Fix 2: Global Rate Limit Enforcement

Added explicit rate limiting with thread-safe global tracking:

```python
# Track last API call time globally
self._last_api_call_time = 0
self._api_call_lock = threading.Lock()
self._min_call_interval = 0.25  # 250ms

def _enforce_rate_limit(self):
    """Enforce minimum time between API calls"""
    with self._api_call_lock:
        current_time = time.time()
        time_since_last = current_time - self._last_api_call_time
        
        if time_since_last < self._min_call_interval:
            sleep_time = self._min_call_interval - time_since_last
            time.sleep(sleep_time)
        
        self._last_api_call_time = time.time()
```

**Features:**
- Thread-safe with lock
- Global tracking across all operations
- Enforces minimum 250ms between ANY API calls

### Fix 3: Rate Limiting in Order Operations

Added explicit rate limiting before each API call:

```python
# Market order creation (AFTER)
if not reduce_only:
    self._enforce_rate_limit()  # Explicit throttling
    self.exchange.set_margin_mode('cross', symbol)
    
    self._enforce_rate_limit()  # Explicit throttling
    self.exchange.set_leverage(10, symbol)

self._enforce_rate_limit()  # Explicit throttling
order = self.exchange.create_order(...)

if order.get('id'):
    self._enforce_rate_limit()  # Explicit throttling
    filled = self.exchange.fetch_order(order_id)
```

**Applied to:**
- `create_market_order()` - 4 explicit rate limit calls
- `create_limit_order()` - 3 explicit rate limit calls
- `create_stop_limit_order()` - 3 explicit rate limit calls
- `cancel_order()` - 1 explicit rate limit call

### Fix 4: Automatic Rate Limiting in All API Wrappers

All API calls go through `_execute_with_priority()` which now includes rate limiting:

```python
def _execute_with_priority(self, func, priority, call_name):
    # Wait for critical calls if needed
    self._wait_for_critical_calls(priority)
    
    # Track critical calls
    self._track_critical_call(priority, increment=True)
    
    try:
        # ENFORCE RATE LIMIT BEFORE EVERY API CALL
        self._enforce_rate_limit()
        
        # Execute the actual API call
        result = func()
        return result
    finally:
        self._track_critical_call(priority, increment=False)
```

**Covers:**
- `get_open_positions()` - Position monitoring
- `get_ticker()` - Price fetching
- `get_ohlcv()` - Candlestick data
- `get_balance()` - Balance checks
- All other API operations

## Testing and Validation

### Test Suite: test_rate_limit_improvements.py

All 5 tests passing:

**Test 1: Rate Limit Override**
```
‚úÖ Rate limit overridden from 75ms to 250ms
‚úÖ Max calls per second: 4.0

```

**Test 2: Explicit Rate Limiting**
```
‚úÖ 5 consecutive calls all 250ms apart
‚úÖ Min interval: 250.1ms
‚úÖ Avg interval: 250.1ms
```

**Test 3: Order Creation Rate Limiting**
```
‚úÖ Order creation: 1253ms total
‚úÖ 3 internal API calls
‚úÖ Min interval: 250.1ms between calls
```

**Test 4: Position Monitoring Rate Limiting**

================================================================================
TEST RESULTS: 5 passed, 0 failed
================================================================================
```

## Performance Impact

### API Call Patterns

**Before Fix:**
- Position monitoring: ~60 calls/min
- Market scanning: ~20-30 calls/min
- Order operations: 4-5 rapid calls per order
- **Risk**: Bursts could exceed 240 calls/min ‚ùå

**After Fix:**
- Position monitoring: ~60 calls/min (unchanged)
- Market scanning: ~20-30 calls/min (unchanged)
- Order operations: 4-5 calls with 250ms spacing (1-1.25 seconds per order)
- **Total**: Max 90 calls/min with enforced spacing ‚úÖ

### Order Execution Speed

**Impact on Order Creation:**
- Market order: ~1.0-1.25 seconds (was instant, but unsafe)
- Limit order: ~0.75-1.0 seconds (was instant, but unsafe)
- Stop-limit order: ~0.75-1.0 seconds (was instant, but unsafe)

**Trade-off**: Slightly slower order execution (by 0.5-1 second) for guaranteed API safety.

### Real-World Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Opening a Position**
```
Before: 4 API calls in ~100ms ‚ùå (too fast)
After:  4 API calls in ~1000ms ‚úÖ (safe)
```

**Scenario 2: Monitoring 3 Positions**
```
Before: 1 call/second = 60/min ‚úÖ (was already safe)
After:  1 call/second = 60/min ‚úÖ (unchanged)
```

**Scenario 3: Opening 3 Positions Simultaneously**
```
Before: 12 calls in ~300ms = burst of 2400/min ‚ùå (rate limit hit!)
After:  12 calls in ~3000ms = 240/min ‚úÖ (safe)
```

## Configuration

No configuration changes needed - all fixes are automatic.

### Optional: Adjust Rate Limit Interval

If you want to be even more conservative:

```python
# In kucoin_client.py __init__
self._min_call_interval = 0.3  # 300ms = 3.3 calls/sec = 200 calls/min
```

### Optional: Increase Position Update Interval

If you want fewer position monitoring calls:

```env
# .env
POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=2.0  # Check positions every 2 seconds (was 1.0)
```

This would reduce position monitoring from 60 calls/min to 30 calls/min.

## Monitoring

### Logs to Watch

**Rate Limit Override (on startup):**
```
‚úÖ Rate Limit Override: 250ms between calls (4 calls/sec max)
```

**Critical API Calls (debug level):**
```
üî¥ CRITICAL API call: create_market_order(BTC/USDT:USDT, buy)
```

### Signs of Rate Limiting Working

**Good signs:**
- No HTTP 429 errors
- All orders execute successfully
- Position updates complete without errors
- Logs show consistent timing between operations

**Warning signs to watch for:**
- Multiple HTTP 429 errors in logs
- "Rate limit exceeded" error messages
- Order failures due to API errors

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Rate Limit Errors

**Solution 1: Increase rate limit interval**
```python
# kucoin_client.py
self._min_call_interval = 0.3  # More conservative
```

**Solution 2: Reduce position update frequency**
```env
POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=2.0
```

**Solution 3: Reduce market scan frequency**
```env
CHECK_INTERVAL=90  # Scan every 90 seconds instead of 60
```

### Orders Taking Too Long

**This is expected and by design.**

Each order now takes ~1 second to complete (with 3-4 API calls).

**Not recommended**: Reducing `_min_call_interval` below 250ms risks rate limiting.

**Alternative**: Use limit orders instead of market orders (fewer API calls).

### Position Monitoring Delayed

If position monitoring feels slow:

**Check interval:**
```python
from config import Config
print(Config.POSITION_UPDATE_INTERVAL)  # Should be 1.0
```

**Note**: Position monitoring is already throttled to 1 second intervals by design.
The rate limiting adds minimal overhead (~250ms max per check).

## Summary

### What Was Fixed

‚úÖ **ccxt rate limit**: Corrected from 75ms to 250ms (safe for KuCoin)
‚úÖ **Order operations**: Added explicit rate limiting (4-5 calls per order)
‚úÖ **Global enforcement**: Thread-safe tracking across all operations
‚úÖ **Concurrent safety**: Position monitoring and scanning can't collide

### Safety Guarantees

‚úÖ **Never exceed 4 calls/second**
‚úÖ **Never exceed 240 calls/minute**
‚úÖ **Thread-safe across concurrent operations**
‚úÖ **Automatic enforcement - no configuration needed**

### Performance Trade-offs

‚öñÔ∏è **Order speed**: +0.5-1 second per order (acceptable for safety)
‚öñÔ∏è **Position monitoring**: Unchanged (already throttled)
‚öñÔ∏è **Market scanning**: Unchanged (already infrequent)

**Result**: The bot is now guaranteed to stay within KuCoin's API rate limits. üöÄ
