## Usage

### 🚀 Quick Deployment to Production

Deploy to a VPS/cloud server in one command:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This will automatically set up everything including systemd service. See [QUICK_DEPLOY.md](QUICK_DEPLOY.md) for details.

For manual deployment or Docker options, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Running the Bot (Development)

```bash
python bot.py
```

### Running the Bot (Production)

With pre-flight checks:

```bash
python3 production_start.py
```

Or as a systemd service (after running deploy.sh):

```bash
sudo systemctl start kucoin-bot
sudo systemctl status kucoin-bot
```

The bot will:
1. Initialize all components and validate configuration
2. **Sync existing positions** from your KuCoin account (if any)
3. Start scanning the market for trading opportunities
4. Execute trades based on the best signals
5. Monitor and update positions with trailing stops
6. Continuously learn and improve from trading outcomes

> **Note**: The bot automatically detects and manages any existing positions on your account, whether they were opened manually or by a previous bot session. See [POSITION_SYNC.md](POSITION_SYNC.md) for details.

### Monitoring

Check bot health:

```bash
python3 health_check.py
```

View logs:

```bash
tail -f logs/bot.log
# or for systemd service:
sudo journalctl -u kucoin-bot -f
```

### Stopping the Bot

Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully stop the bot, or:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop kucoin-bot
```

The bot will:
- Log the shutdown request
- Complete any pending operations
- Optionally close all positions (configurable)
- Save the ML model state

## How It Works

### Signal Generation

The bot generates trading signals using a multi-indicator approach:

1. **Trend Following**: EMA crossovers and moving averages
2. **Momentum**: MACD, RSI, and Stochastic Oscillator
3. **Volatility**: Bollinger Bands and ATR
4. **Volume**: Volume confirmation for signal strength
5. **Machine Learning**: ML model provides additional signal validation

Each indicator contributes to an overall score and confidence level. Trades are only executed when confidence exceeds the threshold (default: 60%).

### Position Management

The bot manages positions with the following features:

- **Existing Position Sync**: Automatically imports and manages positions opened outside the bot
- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Calculates safe position size based on account balance, risk per trade, and stop loss distance
- **Trailing Stops**: Automatically adjusts stop loss to lock in profits as price moves favorably
- **Take Profit**: Sets initial take profit targets based on risk-reward ratio
- **Maximum Positions**: Limits concurrent positions to manage risk

### Machine Learning

The bot includes a self-learning component:

1. Records all trading outcomes (entry indicators, signal, profit/loss)
2. Periodically retrains a Random Forest classifier on historical outcomes
3. Uses the ML model to validate and optimize future signals
4. Improves accuracy over time as it learns from experience

### Risk Management

Multiple layers of risk management:

- **Position Sizing**: Calculates safe position size based on account balance and risk tolerance
- **Stop Loss**: Dynamic stop loss based on market volatility
- **Leverage Adjustment**: Reduces leverage in high volatility or low confidence scenarios
- **Maximum Positions**: Limits total exposure
- **Balance Checks**: Ensures sufficient balance before opening positions

## Logging and Monitoring

Logs are written to both console and file (default: `logs/bot.log`):

- **INFO**: General operation logs (trades, signals, positions)
- **WARNING**: Important notices (insufficient balance, max positions reached)
- **ERROR**: Errors and exceptions with full stack traces

## Safety Features

- **API Error Handling**: Gracefully handles API errors and rate limits
- **Position Validation**: Validates all positions before execution
- **Balance Checks**: Ensures sufficient balance for trades
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Only trades high-confidence signals
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Can be stopped at any time with Ctrl+C

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Risk Warning**: Trading cryptocurrency futures with leverage involves significant risk. You can lose more than your initial investment. Only trade with money you can afford to lose.

- Start with small position sizes to test the bot
- Monitor the bot regularly, especially during the first days
- Adjust risk parameters based on your risk tolerance
- Consider running in paper trading mode first (if supported by exchange)
- Keep your API keys secure and never share them

## Troubleshooting

### Bot won't start
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify API credentials in `.env` file
- Check logs for specific error messages

### No trades being executed
- Check if confidence thresholds are too high
- Verify available balance is sufficient
- Check if maximum positions limit is reached
- Review logs for validation failures

### Positions not closing
- Verify trailing stop configuration
- Check network connectivity to exchange
- Review position status in logs
