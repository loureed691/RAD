## Usage

### Running the Bot

```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot will:
1. Initialize all components and validate configuration
2. **Sync existing positions** from your KuCoin account (if any)
3. Start scanning the market for trading opportunities
4. Execute trades based on the best signals
5. Monitor and update positions with trailing stops
6. Continuously learn and improve from trading outcomes

> **Note**: The bot automatically detects and manages any existing positions on your account, whether they were opened manually or by a previous bot session.

### Stopping the Bot

Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully stop the bot. The bot will:
- Log the shutdown request
- Complete any pending operations
- Optionally close all positions (configurable)
- Save the ML model state

## How It Works

### Signal Generation

The bot generates trading signals using a multi-indicator approach:

1. **Trend Following**: EMA crossovers and moving averages
2. **Momentum**: MACD, RSI, and Stochastic Oscillator
3. **Volatility**: Bollinger Bands and ATR
4. **Volume**: Volume confirmation for signal strength
5. **Machine Learning**: ML model provides additional signal validation

Each indicator contributes to an overall score and confidence level. Trades are only executed when confidence exceeds the threshold (default: 60%).

### Position Management

The bot manages positions with the following features:

- **Existing Position Sync**: Automatically imports and manages positions opened outside the bot
- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Calculates safe position size based on account balance, risk per trade, and stop loss distance
- **Trailing Stops**: Automatically adjusts stop loss to lock in profits as price moves favorably
- **Take Profit**: Sets initial take profit targets based on risk-reward ratio
- **Maximum Positions**: Limits concurrent positions to manage risk

### Machine Learning

The bot includes a self-learning component:

1. Records all trading outcomes (entry indicators, signal, profit/loss)
2. Periodically retrains a Random Forest classifier on historical outcomes
3. Uses the ML model to validate and optimize future signals
4. Improves accuracy over time as it learns from experience

### Risk Management

Multiple layers of risk management:

- **Position Sizing**: Calculates safe position size based on account balance and risk tolerance
- **Stop Loss**: Dynamic stop loss based on market volatility
- **Leverage Adjustment**: Reduces leverage in high volatility or low confidence scenarios
- **Maximum Positions**: Limits total exposure
- **Balance Checks**: Ensures sufficient balance before opening positions

## Logging and Monitoring

The bot uses a comprehensive logging system with four separate log files:

### Main Log (`logs/bot.log`)
- **Level**: INFO (configurable)
- **Content**: General bot operations, trades, signals, and positions
- **Purpose**: High-level overview of bot activity

### Position Tracking Log (`logs/positions.log`)
- **Level**: DEBUG (configurable)
- **Content**: Detailed position lifecycle tracking
  - Position opening with entry price, leverage, stop loss, take profit
  - Real-time position updates with current P/L and market indicators
  - Trailing stop and take profit adjustments
  - Position closing with exit price, final P/L, and duration
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive tracking of all position-related activities

### Market Scanning Log (`logs/scanning.log`)
- **Level**: DEBUG (configurable)
- **Content**: Detailed market scanning activity
  - Individual pair analysis with indicators and signals
  - Scan results and filtering decisions
  - Trading opportunities with scores and confidence levels
  - Scan summaries with top opportunities
- **Purpose**: Complete visibility into market analysis and opportunity detection

### Orders Log (`logs/orders.log`)
- **Level**: DEBUG (configurable)
- **Content**: Detailed order execution tracking
  - All buy and sell orders (market, limit, stop-limit)
  - Order parameters: price, amount, leverage, side
  - Execution details: fill price, slippage, status
  - Order cancellations
- **Purpose**: Complete audit trail of all trading orders

### Log Levels
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for debugging and analysis
- **INFO**: General operational information
- **WARNING**: Important notices (insufficient balance, max positions reached)
- **ERROR**: Errors and exceptions with full stack traces

### Configuration
You can customize the logging behavior in your `.env` file:
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=INFO              # Main log level
LOG_FILE=logs/bot.log       # Main log file
POSITION_LOG_FILE=logs/positions.log   # Position tracking log
SCANNING_LOG_FILE=logs/scanning.log    # Market scanning log
ORDERS_LOG_FILE=logs/orders.log        # Order execution log
DETAILED_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG    # Level for specialized logs
```

## Safety Features

- **API Error Handling**: Gracefully handles API errors and rate limits
- **Position Validation**: Validates all positions before execution
- **Balance Checks**: Ensures sufficient balance for trades
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Only trades high-confidence signals
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Can be stopped at any time with Ctrl+C

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Warning**: Trading cryptocurrency futures with leverage involves significant risk. You can lose more than your initial investment. Only trade with money you can afford to lose.

- Start with small position sizes to test the bot
- Monitor the bot regularly, especially during the first days
- Adjust risk parameters based on your risk tolerance
- Consider running in paper trading mode first (if supported by exchange)
- Keep your API keys secure and never share them

## Troubleshooting

### Bot won't start
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify API credentials in `.env` file
- Check logs for specific error messages

### No trades being executed
- Check if confidence thresholds are too high
- Verify available balance is sufficient
- Check if maximum positions limit is reached
- Review logs for validation failures

### Positions not closing
- Verify trailing stop configuration
- Check network connectivity to exchange
- Review position status in logs
