TRADING BOT FIX - TEST SUMMARY
================================================================

Problem Statement:
------------------
1. Bot doesn't sell - make sure every trading strategy works as intended
2. Breakeven plus, partial selling, take profit, stop loss logic
3. Make sure trades are executed in every case, not 3 retries and stopping

Solutions Implemented:
----------------------

1. ENHANCED RETRY LOGIC
   - Critical operations now retry 9 times (vs 3 before)
   - Added retry loop at close_position level (5 retries)
   - Total: Up to 45 retry attempts for closing positions
   - Exponential backoff to prevent API spam
   - Better error logging

2. PARTIAL EXIT SUPPORT
   - Fixed interpretation of advanced exit signals
   - Correctly handles scale percentages vs stop loss prices
   - Calls scale_out_position for partial exits
   - Marks partial exit orders as critical

3. ALL TRADING STRATEGIES VERIFIED
   - Take profit: ✓
   - Stop loss: ✓
   - Breakeven+ protection: ✓
   - Partial exits (2%, 4%, 6%): ✓
   - Momentum reversal: ✓
   - Profit lock: ✓
   - Intelligent profit taking: ✓

Impact:
-------
BEFORE:
  ❌ Positions could fail to close after 3 retries
  ❌ Partial exits not functional
  ❌ Network issues caused permanent failures
  ❌ No distinction between critical and regular operations

AFTER:
  ✅ Positions have 45 retry attempts to close
  ✅ Partial exits work at profit targets
  ✅ Resilient to transient network/API issues
  ✅ Critical operations prioritized and retried aggressively
  ✅ All exit strategies functional and tested
  ✅ Better error logging for debugging
