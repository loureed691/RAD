## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Questions

**Q: Will this affect my existing bot configuration?**
A: No, all changes are backward compatible. Existing `.env` settings work unchanged.

**Q: How do I view health reports?**
A: Health reports are automatically logged every 15 minutes to `logs/bot.log`

**Q: What if the health check shows WARNING or CRITICAL?**
A: The bot will continue operating but investigate the logged issues. Common causes:
- Slow scans: Check network connection or reduce MAX_WORKERS
- High memory: Restart bot or check for memory leaks
- High errors: Review error logs for patterns

**Q: Can I disable the new features?**
A: The features have negligible overhead and provide valuable monitoring, but you can comment out the initialization in bot.py if needed.

### Getting Help

1. Check logs: `logs/bot.log`
2. Review documentation: `PRODUCTION_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
