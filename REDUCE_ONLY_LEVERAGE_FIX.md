# Fix for KuCoin Error 330008 on Reduce-Only Orders (Close Positions)

## Problem Description

When closing positions, the trading bot was failing with error 330008 from KuCoin:

```
14:25:41 ✓ INFO Exit signal: profit_lock - Profit lock triggered (retraced from 3.28% to 2.05%)
14:25:43 ✗ ERROR Error creating market order: kucoinfutures {"msg":"Your current margin and leverage have reached the maximum open limit. Please increase your margin or raise your leverage to open larger positions.","code":"330008"}
14:25:43 ✗ ERROR Failed to create close order for BNB/USDT:USDT
```

### Root Cause

The issue occurred because:

1. When closing a position, `close_position()` calls `create_market_order()` with `reduce_only=True`
2. The `create_market_order()` method correctly skips margin checks for reduce_only orders
3. **BUT** it still calls `set_leverage()` and `set_margin_mode()` even for reduce_only orders
4. When all available margin is tied up in the position being closed, the `set_leverage()` call fails with error 330008
5. The position cannot be closed, even though it's a reduce-only operation that should always be allowed

### Why This Happens

- KuCoin's API treats `set_leverage()` as an operation that requires available margin
- When all margin is in use by open positions, setting leverage fails with error 330008
- This prevents closing positions even though closing doesn't require new margin

## Solution

Skip the `set_leverage()` and `set_margin_mode()` calls for reduce-only orders since:
- Reduce-only orders are closing existing positions, not opening new ones
- The leverage is already set on the existing position
- No new margin is required or allocated
- The exchange doesn't need leverage to be set when closing

## Changes Made

### File: `kucoin_client.py`

#### Change 1: `create_market_order()` method (Lines 487-504)

**Before:**
```python
# Switch to cross margin mode first (fixes error 330006)
self.exchange.set_margin_mode('cross', symbol)

# Set leverage with cross margin mode
self.exchange.set_leverage(leverage, symbol, params={"marginMode": "cross"})

# Create market order with cross margin mode explicitly set
order = self.exchange.create_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    type='market',
    side=side,
    amount=validated_amount,
    params={"marginMode": "cross"}
)
```

**After:**
```python
# Skip leverage/margin mode setting for reduce_only orders (closing positions)
# Setting leverage on close can fail with error 330008 if all margin is in use
if not reduce_only:
    # Switch to cross margin mode first (fixes error 330006)
    self.exchange.set_margin_mode('cross', symbol)
    
    # Set leverage with cross margin mode
    self.exchange.set_leverage(leverage, symbol, params={"marginMode": "cross"})

# Build order parameters
params = {"marginMode": "cross"}
if reduce_only:
    params["reduceOnly"] = True

# Create market order
order = self.exchange.create_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    type='market',
    side=side,
    amount=validated_amount,
    params=params
)
```

#### Change 2: `create_limit_order()` method (Lines 635-647)

**Before:**
```python
# Switch to cross margin mode first (fixes error 330006)
self.exchange.set_margin_mode('cross', symbol)

# Set leverage with cross margin mode
self.exchange.set_leverage(leverage, symbol, params={"marginMode": "cross"})

# Build order parameters
params = {"marginMode": "cross"}
if post_only:
    params["postOnly"] = True
if reduce_only:
    params["reduceOnly"] = True
```

**After:**
```python
# Skip leverage/margin mode setting for reduce_only orders (closing positions)
# Setting leverage on close can fail with error 330008 if all margin is in use
if not reduce_only:
    # Switch to cross margin mode first (fixes error 330006)
    self.exchange.set_margin_mode('cross', symbol)
    
    # Set leverage with cross margin mode
    self.exchange.set_leverage(leverage, symbol, params={"marginMode": "cross"})

# Build order parameters
params = {"marginMode": "cross"}
if post_only:
    params["postOnly"] = True
if reduce_only:
    params["reduceOnly"] = True
```

## Testing

### New Test: `test_reduce_only_leverage_fix.py`

Created comprehensive test suite with 3 tests:

1. **`test_market_order_reduce_only_skips_leverage()`**
   - Verifies `set_leverage()` is NOT called for `reduce_only=True`
   - Verifies `set_leverage()` IS called for `reduce_only=False`
   - Confirms `reduceOnly` parameter is passed to exchange

2. **`test_limit_order_reduce_only_skips_leverage()`**
   - Same verification for limit orders
   - Ensures consistent behavior between market and limit orders

3. **`test_close_position_with_zero_margin()`**
   - Simulates the exact problem scenario
   - Zero available margin (all in position)
   - Confirms position can be closed successfully
   - Verifies no `set_leverage()` calls

All tests pass: **3/3** ✅

### Regression Testing

All existing tests continue to pass:

- ✅ `test_zero_margin_fix.py` - 3/3 passed
- ✅ `test_exact_problem_scenario.py` - passed
- ✅ `test_close_leverage_fix.py` - 5/5 passed
- ✅ `test_margin_limit_fix.py` - 4/4 passed

## Impact

### Before Fix
```
14:25:41 ✓ INFO Exit signal: profit_lock triggered
14:25:43 ✗ ERROR Error creating market order: {"code":"330008"}
14:25:43 ✗ ERROR Failed to create close order for BNB/USDT:USDT
```

❌ Position cannot be closed
❌ User must manually intervene
❌ Exit signals are ignored

### After Fix
```
14:25:41 ✓ INFO Exit signal: profit_lock triggered
14:25:42 ✓ INFO Closed position for BNB/USDT:USDT with 10x leverage
```

✅ Position closed successfully
✅ No error 330008
✅ Exit signals work as expected

## Benefits

1. **Reliable Position Closing**
   - Positions can always be closed regardless of available margin
   - Exit signals work correctly
   - No manual intervention needed

2. **Correct Behavior**
   - Closing positions doesn't require setting leverage
   - Reduces unnecessary API calls to exchange
   - More efficient order execution

3. **Backward Compatible**
   - No breaking changes
   - All existing tests pass
   - Safe to deploy immediately

4. **Consistent with reduce_only Semantics**
   - reduce_only orders already skip margin checks
   - Now they also skip leverage setting
   - Logical and consistent behavior

## Related Fixes

This fix complements other margin-related fixes:

1. **Margin Limit Fix** (`MARGIN_LIMIT_FIX.md`)
   - Checks available margin before opening positions
   - Adjusts position size if needed
   - This fix: Skips margin/leverage for closing positions

2. **Close Leverage Fix** (`CLOSE_LEVERAGE_FIX.md`)
   - Uses correct leverage when closing positions
   - Extracts leverage from position data
   - This fix: Skips setting leverage entirely for closes

3. **Zero Margin Fix** (`ZERO_MARGIN_FIX.md`)
   - Handles zero margin without division errors
   - Skips margin checks for reduce_only
   - This fix: Also skips leverage setting for reduce_only

Together, these fixes ensure robust position closing under all margin conditions.

## Technical Details

### Order Flow Comparison

**Opening a Position (reduce_only=False):**
```
1. Check available margin ✓
2. Set margin mode to 'cross' ✓
3. Set leverage (e.g., 10x) ✓
4. Create order with marginMode ✓
```

**Closing a Position (reduce_only=True):**
```
1. Skip margin check ✓
2. Skip margin mode setting ✓ (NEW)
3. Skip leverage setting ✓ (NEW)
4. Create order with reduceOnly=True ✓
```

### Why Skip Leverage for reduce_only?

1. **Position Already Exists**: The position being closed already has leverage set
2. **No New Margin**: Closing returns margin, doesn't consume it
3. **API Requirement**: `set_leverage()` requires available margin
4. **Error Prevention**: Prevents error 330008 when margin is fully utilized
5. **Logical Consistency**: Closing doesn't need leverage configuration

## Example Scenario

### Setup
- Account balance: $100 USDT
- Open position: 10 BNB contracts at 10x leverage
- Used margin: $100 USDT (all margin in use)
- Available margin: $0 USDT

### Exit Signal Triggered
```python
# Bot receives profit lock signal
exit_signal = "profit_lock"

# Tries to close position
result = client.close_position('BNB/USDT:USDT')
```

### Before Fix
```
❌ set_leverage(10, 'BNB/USDT:USDT') called
❌ Error 330008: Insufficient margin to set leverage
❌ Position not closed
❌ User misses exit opportunity
```

### After Fix
```
✅ Skip set_leverage() for reduce_only order
✅ Create order with reduceOnly=True
✅ Position closed successfully
✅ User exits at desired price
✅ Margin released: $100 USDT now available
```

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Run Tests**: `python test_reduce_only_leverage_fix.py`
2. **Check Logs**: Look for "Closed position for X with Nx leverage" (no error)
3. **Monitor**: No more error 330008 when closing positions
4. **Verify**: Exit signals execute successfully

## Summary

This fix resolves error 330008 on reduce-only orders by recognizing that closing positions doesn't require setting leverage or margin mode. The solution is simple, logical, and eliminates a critical failure mode when exiting positions with all margin in use.
